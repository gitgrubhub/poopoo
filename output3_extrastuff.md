## Results

Thematic analysis of focus group discussions with older Black adults with chronic pain and depression yielded rich insights into culturally and contextually tailoring Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to enhance relevance, accessibility, and engagement for this population. Participants reflected on existing adaptations and collaboratively identified further refinements spanning program delivery, content, and community integration. Four principal themes emerged: (1) Accessible and technologically inclusive program materials; (2) Simplified and community-relevant resources; (3) Empowerment-focused program structure and activities; and (4) Culturally resonant communication and group norms. These themes underscore the importance of community wisdom for co-creating sustainable, equitable MBCT interventions.

### Simplified and Community-Relevant Resources

**Simplification of Printouts and Visual Aids**  
Participants urged that all print materials and slide presentations should be streamlined for clarity and readability, with minimal jargon and clear visuals. Concise agendas at the start of sessions were recommended to set expectations and orient participants. A community member noted, *“When slides are too packed, it’s just overwhelming. A simple list at the start helps folks know what to expect so they’re not lost.”*

### Empowerment-Focused Program Structure and Activities

**Flexible and Strength-Based Homework Assignments**  
Participants recommended reducing rigid homework requirements, emphasizing skill-building and personal empowerment rather than strict completion. Assignments should affirm participants’ agency and celebrate incremental progress. As one shared, *“Homework shouldn’t stress folks out. It should make you feel like you’re learning something helpful, not like you’re back in school failing.”*

### Culturally Resonant Communication and Group Norms

**Metaphors Reflecting Black Experiences**  
Participants emphasized the need for metaphors and examples that resonate with Black cultural experiences, replacing dense or unfamiliar metaphors with relatable language. A participant highlighted, *“Some metaphors don’t connect with us, so using things from our lives make the ideas stick better.”*

**Relatable Voices and Vernacular in Guided Audios**  
Creating guided meditation and practice audios with voices using familiar vernacular and warm, relatable tones was advocated to increase comfort and engagement. *“Hearing a voice that sounds like you or talks like you helps you feel like you belong and keeps you listening,”* shared a community member.

**Reducing Study Burden with Relevant Measures**  
Participants recommended trimming extensive study questionnaires to lessen burden while including measures reflecting spirituality and community connection, aspects that significantly impact their healing journey.

These findings illuminate how culturally adapting MBCT for older Black adults with chronic pain and depression must transcend mere content translation to incorporate accessibility, empowerment, community ownership, and culturally grounded communication strategies. Integrating these recommendations promises enhanced engagement, acceptability, and sustainability of the intervention within this underserved population.

Sub-theme: Shorter Sessions with Flexible Arrival and Departure Times  
 Opinions on session length varied; while some community experts felt two hours was reasonable, others voiced difficulty managing longer meetings or frequent attendance over several weeks. Community experts viewed shorter sessions as a practical concession to accommodate attendees with health and logistical constraints including older adults with the chronic pain-depression co-morbidity. In addition to session abbreviation, community experts also called for buffer periods to reflect the need for practical and manageable time commitments, with flexibility for late arrivals, longer conversations, and networking opportunities.    

Theme: CBT tailored for more inclusivity and empowerment  
 Sub-theme: Simplify Medical and Psychological Terminology for Understanding  
 CBT was generally endorsed by our team of community experts. However, community experts reported that complex terminology was a recurring barrier. Terms like “cognitive” would require clarification and simple explanations. Plain language, visual aids, and concise highlighting of key points would aid understanding, especially for those facing cognitive or processing challenges. Programs should respect diverse backgrounds and faith traditions in their communication. To address literacy disparities, dense manual sections were proposed to be converted into spoken audio recordings. This would enable those less comfortable with reading to engage fully without feeling excluded.
