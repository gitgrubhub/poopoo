Tony Pham  00:00
Or this, I had to, like, ask MGH to get access to do that.

Doris Jackson  00:07
Hi, Tony.

Tony Pham  00:08
Hi, thanks for coming.

Doris Jackson  00:11
Yeah, welcome. I'm

Tony Pham  00:13
going to give folks a little bit more time. Um, we had, like, a lot of interest in coming to these so we split it up across like today, tomorrow and Thursday for these focus groups. And so maybe I'll give a few more minutes for a few others to trickle in, but otherwise totally down to do it with y'all. And then maybe they'll come for like, tomorrow or Thursday. But really, we don't need too much feedback from too many people, so even if less people show up, I think that's better, because sometimes it's nice to get more more from like a few people than a little from A lot of people. Okay,

Cynthia Cornelius  00:55
good afternoon, everyone.

Anne  00:56
Hi.

Tony Pham  01:02
Getting my computer ready. I

Tony Pham  01:25
you Have a two more Minutes. You

Tony Pham  04:00
Why don't we Get Started? I'm gonna think I'm recording the screen right now and then. I'm gonna share my screen, if I can. Just need y'all to tell me, if you can see my PowerPoint when it comes up.

Anne  04:20
Can you all see this?

Tony Pham  04:22
Okay, so let me get it into slideshow mode. Did we lose? Do we have or Okay, nevermind I forget that my zoom view kind of changes. Okay, let me go into here. Okay, so first, thank you everyone for coming out of curiosity, does everyone here know everyone already? You're

Anne  04:49
welcome. I know we can

Tony Pham  04:52
do some quick names and where we're based out of currently, so I'll call out folks and. And just give me your name, where you are at in the Boston area, and yeah, just how your day is going. So my name is Tony. I live in Somerville currently. And of course, you all know me through this study. Miss Doris.

Doris Jackson  05:20
Hi, I'm Doris Jackson settles. I live in Mattapan area, and my day is so far so good. I'm just, yeah, was waiting on the group, you know, and ready to get started on what we're going to talk about cool.

Tony Pham  05:44
I appreciate that. Um, hi, Miss Cynthia, and then if she touches

Cynthia Cornelius  05:52
her audience, Hey, doctor. I'm Cynthia Cornelius, located in Dorchester, and I know Doctor Pham from quite a few of our networking platforms, and just interested to this time be a participant instead of being a co host. So look forward to

Tony Pham  06:16
thank you and Miss Anne.

Anne  06:22
Hello, I'm Anne bond. I reside in Plymouth mass, and this is my second chronic pain study. I'm eager to learn more what others are doing to control their pain or how they're dealing with it. Thank you.

Tony Pham  06:43
And Miss Cynthia Jones. We're just doing names and where we're at and how our day is going.

Cynthia Jones  06:50
Good afternoon, everyone. Cynthia Jones from Roxbury, Massachusetts, and how's my day going? It's off to a quick start. I really been just catching up on some powerful reading to to inspire my spiritual mode and growth. All right, I'm in a good place. No man,

Nomin  07:17
hi everyone. I've spoken to a few of you guys on the phone before, but my name is nomin. I'm the Research Coordinator for this study. I am currently in Austin, and my day has been busy, but I had a good lunch, so I'm feeling good, excited to speak with everyone.

Tony Pham  07:35
Awesome. Alright, I'm going to do like, a little bit of an intro as far as, like, what's going to happen now, as well as a review of kind of what we've been doing. So this is a focus group. It's going to be a lot less interesting than the other focus groups we've done in the past, because this isn't so much about, you know, talking about who we are and our experiences, but getting specific feedback on a program that we've been making based on the feedback we've already gotten in prior focus groups. Now there's one point of confusion that could possibly happen, and it's that we're working on two different programs, but they're very similar. So this program is about chronic pain and mood, but we also have a separate program about chronic pain and memory issues, and there are going to be two separate projects, somewhat similar in content, but different because they're targeting different issues. That said, again, this is going to be the chronic pain and mood program, and we don't have a fancy name here, because in a later slide, I'm going to put out some names, and would love for some suggestions, either in terms of, oh, like that name looks good, or, you know, another name comes to mind. Would love to hear it. Apologies in advance. These slides don't look pretty. I'm not. I was never, I'd never really got an A plus for presentation, but I try to get all the content in there. And again, it's going to be a little bit dry, because a lot of what I'll be doing is essentially reading passages and parts of the program, some of which are things that we personally made, and some of which are things that are from a program that we based our current program on. And we'll get more into the name of that prior program as well as what it is and everything else in the subsequent slides. Um, another thing I should mention again is that, again, as you can see from this title, this is a Mind Body program for chronic pain and mood. So when we say mind body, we're talking about things like being mindful of the present moment, things like meditation, physical exercises, and it's going to be for chronic pain and mood. And we'll get more into what those terms might mean later. Too, as they're written in the manual. As far as a team, I don't know, hopefully my windows aren't blocking it, but you can see Noman here, obviously, me, some of y'all have talked with Mary, and someone new on the team is Denise. She's actually an undergrad student in Columbia. She kind of helps out from afar, but she's super cool, and I actually hope she joins our team officially outside of her internship. Of course, you all know Mr. Mike Kincaid, he's part of the team as well, has really shepherded this process and helped us with everything we've been doing. And then everyone here, I think that, you know, we're getting feedback, because this is a group effort. And also wanted to thank Miss Cynthia Jones here, she had offered to facilitate the first pilot, which we're hoping to get off the ground as soon as we finish this manual and find out a few more details that we need to figure out. And then, you know, I would say just thank you for like, the announcement, Institute of Health, they are the ones who essentially fund this project. They're based in Baltimore or Bethesda, technically Maryland. There's a few other foundational grants that have helped us out too. But obviously, you know, in this weird world, it really does help when you're financially back and so thankful for that too, and they're also the ones helping with reimbursements and compensations. So what I'd like to do and try to keep this under two hours, but I'm

11:33
gonna go

Tony Pham  11:36
pretty much give like a brief overview of the manual, with a lot of focus on the intro, introduction sections and the session one section, just because I think that's where a lot of the the meat of, like, what we're trying to put out is. And then, you know, we'll go into sessions 234, through eight, but probably not in detail. And I will say they also kind of rehash some concepts that you've already learned in prior sessions. So there's not as much. I mean, they need, need to go into them. In addition, we'll be talking about some of the materials that we'll be using. We'll be listening to an audio recording to get your feedback. This is actually an audio recording from the original program. We'll look at some handouts to get ideas about your thoughts on those handouts. And yeah, we'll also look at some source materials that may or may not be good, but when you love to hear your feedback on that. So as noted before, the first section is the introduction. Session One is orientation and introductions. Session two is awareness of the body and automatic pilot. Session Three is gathering this gathered mind. Session Four is recognizing thinking. Session Five is thoughts are not facts. Session Six is allowing letting be session seven, taking care of myself. Sessions eight, maintenance. And then there's the conclusion section. So you know, a few things that we should also mention in relation to this program. We're looking to increase engagement as much as possible. So we've thought to essentially change a lot of the formatting of the original manual, originally, it's all in kind of like a text slash, like PDF format that is like you're reading it and seeing the pictures. But we think that a lot of the content might be more engaging if it's in video format. So we're going to try to turn a lot of the material that you'll see in these subsequent slides in a video format that is like me or no man or Mary, one of us will be essentially talking through and potentially showing some diagrams on the screen too. We'll also have audio recordings for guided practice of the techniques at home. Again, you know, I think this is all to see if we can increase engagement. If you see maybe an issue here. We would love to hear that. You know, there are some questions about like, Oh, should we make this an app? Should we put this on a website? I think having a website probably would be easiest, just because people don't need to download another app on their phone. And if they, by any chance, don't have a phone or a regular phone, they can also access it on a computer and the library, there's a question of physical location still and the best day of the week. So with all this said, I'd like to pause for a moment and remind everyone you know, you can always interrupt me, just start talking and just say something if you have an idea or have a thought. But what are your thoughts so far? Just in terms of video recordings, audio recordings, having a website, having a physical but also hybrid. And what day of the week do you think it would be best to have it? I.

Cynthia Cornelius  15:01
Uh, now, when you say day of the week to have it, is this going to be ongoing, and if so, for how long? Yeah, that's

Tony Pham  15:10
a good point. I kind of jumped the gun with this question, because I I'll get into it later. But so this program is actually going to be for eight weeks, each session is going to be for one hour, and it'll be one session for every week. So it's a one hour session once a week for eight weeks. And as a result, usually when it comes to delivering a program, we try to make it consistent. So let's like, you know, with the Thursdays groups, you know, like having it on a regular period is kind of nice so people can remember. So we're thinking about having it on a day of the week, you know, could be like a Tuesday. Maybe weekends are better. I guess I'm just curious again, because we want to make this as accessible as possible, I'm realizing I probably should have put this slide a little later in the slide deck. But another thing that I'll get into is sort of like the why of this program. But I'm curious in terms of, like, general availability, um, when people are trying to make it to like health programs, is it like, are weekdays better? Are weekends better generally?

Doris Jackson  16:33
I think weekends for me would be better. Um, okay,

Tony Pham  16:39
gotcha. Um,

Cynthia Cornelius  16:41
I think I kind of agree, because people are engaged in different groups or studies or their daily platforms or, you know, maybe it's work. So that may be sort of a weekend, a Saturday morning or Saturday afternoon. However, I'm wondering, how are you getting the consensus of what people want? Is it the different? Is it just from us in this group, or is it, would you have people? Are you advertising to get that? I'm just wondering. Yeah,

Tony Pham  17:19
we're thinking about it ahead of hand. I think it would be nice to be able to just have it on a regular day every week and just kind of advertise it from the get go, that it'll be like a Saturday afternoon program. But I think we could also be flexible. You know, if when we do the pilot, and there's about eight people in the first pilot, if they all say, like, no, Saturday is not going to work, obviously we won't do it on third Saturday. Do it on third Saturday, but, yeah, it just might be good to think about now. But it does sound like maybe weekend in general, maybe like afternoon on a Saturday might be easiest for folks.

Cynthia Cornelius  17:57
Yeah, and that way you won't get a whole gambit of, you know, oh, I need this day. I need this day, I need that day. Just put it out there for Saturday morning, if that's what you're thinking. And that way whoever can attend will attend. Whoever can't, you know, won't, but that may save you and the team a lot of back and forth on what will work, what day will work? So yeah, I like

Tony Pham  18:20
that, and I'm glad that you're telling us Saturday too might be the day that most people can make it at least. Um, Cool, alright. And then, you know, we're still working out to see if we can deliver this program at Central Boston in Roxbury, but you know, I think they're really busy, so we're still waiting to hear out when they might have availability with their spaces, in the light in the possibility that we can't get that space, I'm curious. Sorry,

Doris Jackson  18:53
we're central Boston. Listen to Boston. We're in central Boston. What?

Tony Pham  18:58
Oh, sorry, it's in Roxbury. I think it's near Jackson Square, central Boston elder services. I can send you the address after this, but it's definitely in Roxbury. Yeah. And I'm curious if there are other locations you all think might be good for having, like, a Mind Body program, like, I think Grove Hall library, for instance, we've done a few focus groups. There any other ideas? Maybe like the Kroc Center? Oh, yeah, that

Doris Jackson  19:32
would be good. The Croc Center's good location. What about the Roxbury library? Mm,

Tony Pham  19:39
okay, sounds good. We can reach out to them. Yeah, I

Cynthia Cornelius  19:43
was going to say in the any of the libraries on the main route, maybe like Mattapan that, you know, that's the 28 bus, and the Roxbury one that's in Nubian square. And, yeah, I thought about the. What is it in Grove hall with Miss Ada and Ayanna, but they, I don't think they're open on Saturdays the right? Yeah, they're not open on Saturdays. I don't believe, but, oh, okay,

Tony Pham  20:13
we're tight with them, though, so we could potentially know, right,

Cynthia Cornelius  20:16
right, right? I think the libraries are pretty central for a lot of us in the community. So that sounds like a go or two place. Yeah, I

Tony Pham  20:28
think it'd be nice too, because they do their own advertising for programs there, and it might be a good way to get the word out, not that we're currently in the process of trying to spread this out too widely. And then, you know, just in terms of like having a website, having the material as, like video and audio recordings, in addition, you know, with like text and stuff, does that sound okay for y'all? When it comes to like learning new material,

Doris Jackson  20:55
this sounds okay for me, yeah.

Tony Pham  20:57
And then when it comes to like, listening to audio, watching video, especially when it comes to learning new things, do you feel like there's a max time limit after which you know, you feel like, okay, after five minutes, 10 minutes, it's going to be hard to keep folks attention.

Doris Jackson  21:19
Probably,

Tony Pham  21:22
would you say like 30 minutes or 10 minutes? Or what do you think

Anne  21:27
you may have for the session?

Tony Pham  21:31
Oh, no, just, just, these are separate recordings. So we have the sessions, which are an hour, but then we have materials that we offer for people to watch before the session, or to listen to to practice on their own. But you know, if you are by yourself and you're you're either watching these recordings or listening to these recordings, do you feel like there's a time limit after which it might be considered too long? Hmm,

Cynthia Cornelius  21:59
I think if you're giving it to us, like week one or week two, and we need to have looked at it by week three. You know? We just pace ourselves through the material. Okay? Sounds good? Yeah,

Tony Pham  22:13
yeah. And we don't have too many, I think we'll just have video recordings for each of the H sessions, and then I think we have about seven or eight audio recordings that we may or may not decrease the length of. Okay, so you know what I'll do now is probably what I should have done before that previous slide, which is kind of walk folks here through the introduction section of the manual. And again, it's going to be

Cynthia Jones  22:40
dry and I've been dropping stuff in the chat, so hopefully, oh, you have Okay, and other people have as well. Oh,

Tony Pham  22:48
no, man, could you Izzy, right now? Could you copy that stuff? Thanks, Norman, yeah.

Cynthia Jones  22:54
I just want to quickly say to him, I put in for the time thing. As far as you know, I know that you all were talking about more like 30 minutes, and I, I suggested the less than three minutes, like, if you could break the videos up into small pieces, so that when, if someone can only watch three minutes now, three minutes later, three whatever you know to get content, it's easier to absorb and remember and even some steps in small pieces compared to, you know, it's going to be really hard. You all can, you all can say, you know, chime in on this, but it's really hard to keep the attention of, you know, the elderly as well as, I mean, really, in this day and age, you know the young people as well, but parents and them consuming information, but to sit and watch a three minute video, you're like, Oh, I got that. Okay, I got that. Okay, I got what they're saying. And if you watch two or three videos at a time, fine, and you go back and you watch some more, fine. But if it's broken up in infamous compared to you have to keep going back and stopping it and all of that, then it becomes more confusing, especially when we're talking about mood and pain and all these other things. People may want to go back. Let me go back and watch that specific video. Let me go back to that because I didn't understand it. It's broken up in small chunks. Than is, it makes it more orderly and easier to absorb.

Anne  24:26
Yeah, right.

Doris Jackson  24:29
I think so too.

Tony Pham  24:32
Awesome. I appreciate that, because I think that one thing I kind of forget is how many years I spent just reading and watching really long videos. And I think that we as a society are kind of moving towards shorter media, you know, with like Tiktok and Facebook and Instagram. So I agree. I think that we can definitely work towards that and appreciate the feedback, because at present, the audio recordings that we have to base our content on, they're like, they. Range from five to 45 minutes. And of course, 45 minutes is too long, especially based off what y'all are saying. So it seems like even the five minute one might be too long, but regardless, later in this focus group, we'll listen to the five minute recording. And I'd be curious to hear what y'all thoughts are, not only in terms of the length, but just, you know the wording and how it's said, because we will be recording our own version, but we'll take you all feedback to figure out how to do it, including making it shorter and breaking it up. So anyway, just going to read off. These are just snippets from the introduction section, as well as just throughout the manual. I would include the whole thing, but it's just, unfortunately, we don't have too much time. So as the introduction, you know, you'll see the term the name quiet focus. Throughout this quiet focus has sort of been our code name. We had to use something when we submitted our project for funding through the NIH, the National Institute of fund health. And so we tentatively, just kind of call it a quiet focus. But again, we're going to get to another slide where we ask you all for feedback on the name. And I think it would be really nice to get feedback on that, because, you know, I think a name can really make or break a program. But okay, so welcome to quiet focus, the eight week mind body, community and culture program for those dealing with chronic pain, there are the added layers, layers of figuring out how to manage pain, worrying of a physical activity that may cause pain, and feeling stressed and unhappy because we cannot engage in life as we previously had, um, sorry, I lost my cursor. Um, we can't completely avoid stress, difficult emotions than the reality of living with chronic pain, but we can learn how to manage the stress and sadness around chronic pain, gradually increase our physical activity, reconnect with life's important moments, and improve our overall well being and satisfaction with life. The goal of the quiet focus programs to help people with chronic pain improve their mood, physical functioning and overall well being. What exactly is quiet focus and what will we do in this program? Quiet focus is an in person program for individuals who live with chronic pain and are unhappy about it. Each session will last about one hour and repeat once a week for eight weeks. Quiet focus is based off of mindfulness based cognitive therapy, a well known Mind Body program with scientific evidence for improving mood among those of chronic pain. During the quiet focus program, you will discuss what it means to be chronically in pain and unhappy, and practice techniques for improving emotional well being in the context of chronic pain, quiet focus is different from mindfulness based cognitive therapy, because it's added because of its added focus on culture and community. Thus, we want to make quiet focus accessible for all cultures and communities. To do so, we must assess its susceptibility and feasibility across different races and ethnicities, income levels, genders, etc. In this pilot, we will assess whether quiet focus is acceptable and a feasible program for the older black community. In preparation of this pilot, we developed quiet focus in collaboration with input from individuals that's y'all who have identified as older as an older black individual with the history of feeling unhappy about their chronic pain. Um, each member of this pilot has also identified that's the pilot that will be coming up, not this focus group as an older black individual with a history of feeling unhappy about their chronic pain. Um, feedback from this pilot will inform later iterations of this program. Um, sorry, Miss Cynthia, I don't I didn't actually remember where you're from, but I was just kind of drafting this stuff. Um, each session will include an overall theme where you will learn and practice exercises made to help you manage and cope with the stress and unhappiness it comes with chronic pain, and you may be asked to practice these exercises at home to help you develop these skills more effectively. Um, been saying a lot. I'm just curious what y'all think overall about that content, which we probably will plan to condense a bit more and put it into video format. But um, yeah. Does it read? Okay? Does it track? Okay? Um,

Cynthia Cornelius  29:01
it does. I know this. You said it's an in person program. So it's only in person is any part. No, let me if any is any part of it virtual for those that, excuse me, want to attend and can't, if or if they can attend in person, then, then this program is not for them. I'm just curious. Yeah,

Tony Pham  29:25
that's that's something I should have added in the wording. Now that I think about it, because based on feedback previously, we did hear that hybrid is the best. Um, so while the focus of the program is in person, we definitely want to make it accessible. If something comes up and you need to attend by phone because you're somewhere. So we'll definitely change this wording to be hybrid, so that people.

Cynthia Cornelius  29:51
Let me ask you, why is it? Is it key to be important? I mean in person for parts of it, or. Or not really key or, I'm just wondering, you know, yeah, so that's why you change anything, yeah,

Tony Pham  30:06
yeah, yeah. I will say, you know, back in the day, before you know, I was even in existence, I would say these kind of programs were all in person, and then these days, they're more like, almost entirely virtual. But I think that one thing we've heard from other people, at least here in like the Boston area, is that they do enjoy the in person. But, you know, like the Thursday group or UCB you know, the the Zoom is also nice, but it could be delivered either way. I just think that from what we heard previously, people kind of might connect more if they were in person.

Doris Jackson  30:48
Sorry, I like in person.

Tony Pham  30:51
That's good to hear.

Cynthia Cornelius  30:54
Yeah, just wondering. Thanks for the explanation

Doris Jackson  30:59
in here, there, I like to see people in here what they're going through that, you know, in person, that will help me, or maybe I can help them, because I I go through moods with my chronic pain a lot. I think

Tony Pham  31:19
that's good to know too, because I feel that we're all different. And you know, some people connect pretty well over zoom, and some people may not. So perhaps giving people that option might help them figure out how they want to connect with others, even if you know the person on the receiving end might like it more in person or something, but it should be too bad. I think we've certainly seen hybrid programs happen before. Generally, there's just a camera, a laptop, and then the instructor interview, hopefully the others too. Because another thing that we've tried to integrate into this program that's separate from the base program, that mindfulness based cognitive therapy is emphasizing the group and how we as a community can come together and share ideas, but also be led through this program about mindfulness and meditation, other thoughts before I read out some other stuff,

Cynthia Cornelius  32:16
I just wanted to say I think it's kind of two Fold, because there may be some that have such debilitating chronic pain that they may not be able to make it. You might you you want to think of the time of year because of inclement weather or snow, but then also just to get people out once a week for that stretch of eight week program, just to get out of the house and and be with people like the lady just said, I forgot your name. I'm sorry. Um, Doris just mentioned so it's kind of two fold. So that's that maybe a choice to figure out. But yeah, yeah,

Tony Pham  32:51
I could see different routes too, maybe in the distant future, the some programs, some versions, will be all virtual, and some will be all in person, and I'll talk about that more with Mr. Kincaid and my my research boss too, Dr Anna, Maria Rian chianu. Okay. Other thoughts, I love this, by the way. Thanks so much for all the feedback. This is super helpful, sure. Okay, so getting the most out of the quiet focus program. Quiet focus primarily aims to enhance emotional well being and physical activity. However, improving emotional well being and physical activity may indirect, indirectly, decrease the intensity and sorry, intensity of your pain, as well as increase your tolerance of it. The emotional and physical benefits may not be immediate. However, research shows that participants who attend more sessions and consistently engage in home practice, even when it feels challenging, experience the greatest benefits patience and persistence are essential for success. Each session builds on the previous one, so regular attendance daily home practice and completing worksheets are vital for maximizing your learning and progress throughout the program. Then we go into some program details, the logistics, we talked about some of the format, the length, we talked about the guided videos and audio recordings, and then confidentiality. We just talked about some general rules that I think a lot of folks here have heard, either through UCB or Thursday group. You know, we asked everyone to respect the privacy of others during the sessions, the facilitator may encourage you to share out your experiences, the chronic pain, stress, sadness or the program self in terms of the ground rules. If you can to test this antenna session, please let the facilitator know be on time. You know that you can reach out to us, just a reminder to review the workbook before every session, which will be the website, treat everyone kindness and respect. Turn off or silence your phone to minimize distraction. And are there other kinds of ground rules or reminders that we should make sure to tell people? I can also make sure to review the Thursday ground rules too, because I like those.

Cynthia Cornelius  35:12
Oh yeah, please feel free to use those norms I was I had just written down minimum sessions. You might want to put that in there, but I see that you put commit to attending all sessions. So I like that being in print so that, you know, people can see that they shouldn't just try to waltz in and hit every other one or hit, yeah, yeah. So I like seeing that in there. Thanks Tony

Tony Pham  35:37
amazing. Okay, we'll keep it in there then, and then we kind of go into the the ideas about or we go into some terms and points that we will be discussing throughout the manual. So one of the first sections as part of the intro is key points about chronic musculoskeletal pain. The first sub point is like, why do we experience pain? And so pain is your brain's alert system. Pain is a signal from your brain through your nerves to your body. And then we offer people this illustration that basically talks about, you know, one that you know, there's this initial trigger with the burn, the brain interprets that signal. The pain signal travels to your brain, and brain sends a response to us to move away from the hot plane that I see Miss Cynthia, raise her hand, and I also want to just give space for folks to talk.

Cynthia Jones  36:32
Is this I missed it? Did you say that this is the presentation itself or or is this more of a manual that's going to be given. Yeah, yeah.

Tony Pham  36:42
So this is, this is more just the general content. We're going to divide it up. So the plan is we're going to take the original manual, which is a bit text heavy. It does have diagrams and pictures and some quotes and stuff, but we just think it's a little bit too dense, kind of consistent with what you were saying about, like, how videos themselves should be, you know, pretty short and bite sized. And so what we'll do is we'll convert a lot of the material into these, like, bite size, three minute, five minute videos and audio recordings. So like, these things will be essentially in video format, but we will have, like, a manual on the website for like key points that kind of outline what each session is about, but the meat of the content will be in the videos and the audios,

Cynthia Jones  37:34
okay, but this isn't going to be I'm asking because I felt like the parts that you did before you got here, although they were bulleted, they were like this. They can be condensed more. Okay, you know that people aren't reading, reading, reading, because if people have processing issues, and sometimes I do, you just start getting lost in all of that reading from point to point, and it's too much information, so just kind of sticking with, you know what? I mean, just the highlights. Yeah,

Tony Pham  38:08
no, I love that. I think that I definitely have a habit of writing a bit too much. So I think also consistent with the feedback to make these videos shorter will also make the content shorter too and less wordy, because I think that just saying too much too can be confusing, especially when some of these concepts might be themselves confusing. Let's see someone just entered the waiting room. Jules rod must be a

Anne  38:47
two. Hi, Miss Jules,

Tony Pham  38:53
hi, it's Blanca. My, oh, okay, hey, you know, if you want, we're also doing a session tomorrow and Thursday, if you want to get the whole thing.

Doris Jackson  39:07
Yeah, have my uncle passed away, so that's why, yeah, it was just a crazy day today for me. It's okay,

Anne  39:15
don't worry. Yeah, I'll do tomorrow. Um, that'll

Doris Jackson  39:18
be perfect. I'll do

Anne  39:19
tomorrow. Alright,

Tony Pham  39:20
I'll send you the link, but it's one to three tomorrow too. Okay, okay,

Anne  39:24
sounds good.

Cynthia Cornelius  39:27
You have my condolences, dear. Thank you. Thank you. Um, that'd

Doris Jackson  39:31
be great. I'll do it tomorrow.

Tony Pham  39:33
Alright, thank you so much for checking in with us, though. Appreciate hearing your voice.

Anne  39:37
No problem. Okay, have a good one. Take care.

Tony Pham  39:44
Okay, cool. And I'm going to keep that in mind as I read some of these other slides and snippets too, because I do think that they can also be quite long. So this is like the pain explanation coming up, like, what do we mean by musculoskeletal pain? All. Obviously, now that I'm reading this, you know, it seems kind of long, we start by talking about how pain can start after an injury, blah, blah, blah, and sometimes without explanation, some pain, like arthritis, simply happens as we get older, because we have different types of pain. We have different terms for the different types of pain. These include musculoskeletal pain, nerve pain, cancerous pain, and it's important to distinguish among these different types of pain, because different types of pain may require different treatments, and this program focuses on musculoskeletal pain that is non cancerous, pain in one's bones, muscles or tissues. And what do we mean by chronic pain? Chronic Pain can last for months or even years, even after you physically heal. Within the medical community, the term chronic and chronic pain typically refers to pain lasting for more than three months, and this program focuses on techniques that primarily work for chronic pain as the treatments for chronic pain different from acute pain or pain lasting for less than three months. This is a nice diagram that actually Mary put together, so it kind of goes through the process of acute pain and chronic pain, and also somehow some of the helpful and unhelpful responses we we engage in when we're in acute or chronic pain, some of which some of the unhelpful responses, include isolating or avoiding. But I think what's key here is that, you know, in the acute stage, the injury is still there, and so the alert makes more sense. But sometimes in chronic pain, the alert lingers, but the injury itself is no longer there. And so sometimes it's almost like we're acting on something that has already resolved itself, even though the pain is obviously still felt, which can be a bit controversial, I think, because I think we want to toe the line between knowing that, you know, there are potentially times when there are new injuries and such, but there's also the the scenario in which The injury has already healed, but the pain remains

Doris Jackson  42:02
with the with moods also becoming depressed.

Tony Pham  42:06
I'm glad you. Yeah, I think mood is definitely something that comes into play too with chronic pain, and I think that it's why I think this program is interesting, because we focus on chronic pain, and we also focus on the idea that, you know, at that stage, you know, after the three month mark, or sometime after that, you know, our mood can turn sour, and that can definitely color how we view our pain or how we view ourselves in our day. And that actually dovetails into this. So we go into what else shapes pain. Many factors shape chronic pain, not simply how you got injured or treated. For example, whether you can access medical care or the way in which you express your pain may depend on your ethnicity, race, culture, gender and so forth. You know, let's consider race, and we offer a few examples in which say, older black adults have reported higher rates of chronic pain conditions. Also how older black adults have also reported more challenges in receiving pain management, again, compared to older white adults. And then you know other fact, another factor is physical mobility. So like we mentioned before, you know, if you are in pain. You may not be walking, you may be avoiding activities, and that can also make you feel down or and the lack of physical activity can make the pain get worse. And then when you try to make it up for lost time, you may do too much and then be in more pain. So it's kind of a tricky cycle with all these factors going on. And then we go over some chronic pain treatments. You know, because pain, there is no one size fits all model for managing chronic pain. So here we talk about medications, physical therapy and exercise, alternative therapies, behavioral treatments. And then we talk about the relationship, like y'all said, between chronic pain and emotional well being. You know, the relationship between chronic pain and emotional well being does not simply flow in one direction. Your emotional well being may influence chronic pain, and chronic pain may influence your emotional well being. For example, chronic pain get in the way of work and family commitments, which can be frustrating, and this extra baggage on top of the pain, can make the pain feel even worse or burdensome. And here we give, like a little case example. We just, or I rather, just, kind of randomly chose the name Linda. So here, in this example, where emotional well being and chronic pain are at play. You know, Linda enjoys going for walks with her grandkids one day, however, a car unexpectedly collides with her. She has recovered from this car accident. However, since then, she's experienced chronic pain in her shoulder. Despite multiple medical workups, doctors were not able to pinpoint why she has continued to experience pain. They were, however, able to rule out other life threatening causes such as cancer. Regardless, she has continued to worry about why her shoulder pain has not gone away to the point of losing. Sleep, she now has trouble planning out her life, and no longer goes on walks as she used to. She now notices a significant drop in her physical functioning and quality of life. Her pain also feels worse at this point. She now feels hopeless over whether she will ever get better. And we talk about how this is something that we refer to as the downward spiral, and here we have another diagram. We do need to modify it a little bit, but you can kind of see how there's like a pain alert, the person can start to have these negative thoughts about themselves, negative feelings about themselves, which lead to behaviors that could include social withdrawal or physical activity withdrawal, which in itself, can worsen pain outcomes because you're not moving as much, which is more important in the chronic stage as opposed to the acute stage. And then lastly, we talk about preventing additional chronic pain burden and suffering. And we talk about how this program is about targeting the downward spiral, and how that, by default, also targets the pain. And so in this program, we place you, the person living with pain, firmly and powerfully in the driver's seat, so that you can recognize when you were caught in the downward spiral and actively reverse gears into what we call the upward spiral. And so as part of this program, as part of the upward spiral, you'll be whoopsie learning about how your thoughts affect your feelings, your behavior and your pain, how to focus your attention and to be in the moment, how to become aware of and deal with thoughts and feelings in a new way, or simply let them go, how to work with stress and pain so that It causes less suffering. You also learn other skills to cope with your chronic pain, such as meditation. And when we move along the upward spiral, we do not aim to eliminate chronic pain from our lives. Instead, we aim to recenter our focus and accept chronic pain without judgment, by non judgmentally gazing at our pain. We also learn to live our lives as we once did. This includes feeling more happy and satisfied with life, improving our physical functioning and perhaps even increasing our tolerance for pain. Here's another graphic made by Mary. So I know that's a lot. Kind of ended with this quote, you have a full and interesting life. Chronic pain does not have to overshadow all aspects of your daily life. So yeah, just in terms of the introduction. I know that's a lot, but I also feel like it's the most important part, because it's where we're really starting to introduce people to the program. And I think that could be a really sensitive time when people are really thinking about, Okay, do I want to do this program? Do I not want to do this program? And so, you know, some of the feedback we've gotten is, you know, making the wording a lot shorter and more bite sized, as well as the audio and video recordings. Were there other things that left out of you when you were hearing that from me, as far as, like, you know, our introduction to chronic pain, as well as some of the aspects of the program.

Cynthia Cornelius  48:01
So I was writing down as as you was going along, you know me and my details, yeah, um, so when you just said introduction, I'm like, All That Was introduction. So just hear me out. It was a bit worthy. However it's necessary. I think it all depends on how it's disseminated and broken up? Is all that going to be at the beginning? Maybe at some pieces at the beginning of each eight week session. I'm not sure if that can be managed. You know how it's shared each session. I believe the pictorials are helpful. It kind of draws your attention to the material and not so much text, but let's, you know, let's throw those in there, especially when there's some color to it. Um, so the in the facilitator may want to kind of read through some depending on what the agenda for the week is. Instead of giving it up to us to read and go through or some key points, you may want to make sure you read and touch on, so that will come across. Um, but, yeah, I thought that's a lot for introduction. However, if pieces can be put per eight week session introduction and get the key points at the beginning, you know, that way. But make it draw us to it, you know, make it interesting so that you will keep our attention. And I think the pictorials help that way. Thank you. Gotcha.

Tony Pham  49:27
Okay. I love that. I can definitely, our team can definitely get working on more pictorials. And I think we can move some of this stuff to the later sessions, especially the nitty gritty about, like, what is chronic pain? And then why are we focusing on the emotions and the sadness and the unhappiness around chronic pain, cool, other thoughts, other that you might have had while hearing all that,

Cynthia Jones  49:56
there's one thing I want to that jumped out to me. It was the. List that of you know of the suggestions, the suggested things to to help, and the right there. And the first thing that you have on the list is medication. And I think that should be at the bottom, because if we're focused on doing different things to try to help manage the pain. It's not taking away the medication, but we don't want, yeah, I know, as a doctor, you probably think medication,

Anne  50:31
but yeah,

Cynthia Jones  50:33
people away from that, then it should be somewhere else, further down the list, rather than the first thing they see in their that's the first go to so that's a good point that jumped up to me.

Tony Pham  50:44
Yeah, no, I think you caught me right there, because I do always think about medications first, but I do think that this program is about trying to find a balance, so that we're not entirely dependent on medications, and that we are using kind of like this multi tool approach with, you know, both medications that are prescribed to us and all these other things awesome we gotta and I think that makes sense. And I think that it also makes me think that I should emphasize more throughout this program that this is not a program about medications, you know, this is about this is a behavioral program so that we can think about, you know, our thoughts and emotions and feelings, as well as engage in some coping skills for chronic pain, cool, other thoughts before we come to the next session,

Cynthia Cornelius  51:31
mentioning coping skills. I love the case studies. They're very interesting, you know. So maybe a case study per week, you know, that okay, that we can kind of listen to, or maybe it may resonate with others and also offer up, somewhere along the eight weeks, I'm not sure how often, offer up an opportunity for people to share what their coping skills are, and that's okay learn from each other. Yeah,

Tony Pham  51:57
yeah. Maybe in the beginning of each session, as people are reflecting on what they practice, they can share out their own kind of coping skills. Because I do think that's one of the things that I think our program will be different. Because, you know, we're all about like, group learning, whereas, typically, you know these, these programs are about the the the facilitator to the the the attendee relationship, uh, whereas this will be, you know, there's going to be a facilitator, but it's also the attendee sharing out how they cope with chronic pain and any tricks of the trade that they might have learned through life that you know might not be in a medical textbook or somewhere.

Doris Jackson  52:39
That's pretty what I was saying, that was pretty much what I was saying, share their different techniques on like what they go through and how, what do they do about their pain?

Tony Pham  52:57
Yeah, I've learned so much actually doing the focus groups with y'all, because not only have I become more aware of the resources available around here, but yeah, just the little things that people have used, some of the bombs people have used, tinctures and stuff like that. So definitely want people to continue passing on information like that, especially within a safe space like this, where people might not feel as ashamed you know about being chronic pain or feeling unhappy about it, pool beans, other thoughts. All right, um, do, all right. So interestingly, we changed the four the format, a little bit of the original program. So in the original program,

Anne  53:46
we

Tony Pham  53:48
we just went directly into like, you know, what is mindfulness? What is meditation? What is, what are some of the skills? But I feel like, judging from the conversations we've had in previous focus groups, it might be nice to start a bit slower and give people space during the first session to orient to the program and do some introductions and generally learn about mindfulness. And so we've actually kind of condensed some of the information that was originally in session one, which was about, you know, some of the awareness techniques, and push them to session two and three. And so as part of the introduction, think, nomen, this is the connection game. So here we wrote, every person takes turns sharing a story related to a hobby or activity that they are interested in. And then once one person is shared, everyone has to respond with one sentence of the story, whether it's a question or sharing similar experiences, we're able to find common ground and get to know each other better. We also talk about setting expectations, similar to the the introduction texts. So you know, we're just reinforcing that this is a place to support and communicate with each other, to listen, actively, participate, actively, to. Um and protect the confidentiality of what's said in the group. We go briefly into the mindfulness so this is actually from the original text. You know here it says, what is mindfulness and how can it help? Mindfulness is about noticing whatever experience we're having, including any thoughts, feelings or physical sensations that may arise in a given moment. Many of our reactions to stressful events seem to happen automatically, meaning we may not be aware of them, and they seem to unfold without our choosing, but these automatic reactions can increase our distress. And then here, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's kind of like a passage about how to become mindful. And again, you know, we're going to convert most of this to like a video format and hopefully less words and more bite size, so three to five minutes. It's important to understand that mindfulness not a destination or something we achieve. Next paragraphs. One way to practice mindfulness is through meditation. The next paragraph is another important way to practice mindfulness is informal practice, which is simply bringing mindfulness to your daily activities. In this program, you will learn these practices and will be encouraged to practice them daily, just like with physical exercise. This is the best way to strengthen the mindfulness muscle so that you are ready to use it when faced with stress, just reading or talking about mindfulness won't help you learn to use it. And then this is actually a quote from one of the original developers of a similar program, Jon Kabat Zinn, he says, make sure you weave your parachute every day, rather than leave it to the time you have to jump out of the plane. We'll get to this idea later, of there being like snippets and quotes throughout the manual, because it would be nice to maybe get voices in the manual that people may be more familiar with, rather than say, like Jon Kabat Zinn who, although famous, like within, like scientific circles and like the mindfulness circles and so forth, you know, might not be on everyone's mind. And then we hear this is another diagram where we talk about how we're going to use mindfulness to switch out of some negative states and into some positive states, such as automatic pilot to awareness and attention, or from reacting to responding from unhealthy habits to taking care of ourselves. And then here I talked about some of the audio recordings we have available. Um, you know, there's a mindful walking and mindful movement, both originally 20 minutes a body scan, that's five minutes and 45 minutes in length. Those are two separate recordings. And then we have two separate recordings for each of these seated meditation um, instructions, one is 20 minutes, and another is 45 minutes, obviously, just even just from this focus group alone, those are way too long, so we'll have to condense them and or break them apart. And I was hoping that we could actually listen to one together, which is the body scan I'm going to try to play it from YouTube, but if that doesn't work, like if the audio doesn't go to your computer or your phone, I'll just put the link in the chat and you can listen to it, um, independently. Um, so actually, just before I start and I apologize, today's trash day, so I don't know if y'all can hear the trash can, or the the folks taking out the trash?

Cynthia Cornelius  58:25
No, I can't hear

Tony Pham  58:28
y'all hear that. No, okay, no, I'm going to put the link in the chat. Would y'all be all comfortable with like clicking it and then listening to it?

Cynthia Cornelius  58:39
Sure. Alright, let me and when you're using these Tony, is this going to be like, maybe a bibliography in within the on the website, or within the manual, or are they going to be, I heard you say you can practice some as a group, which I think is ideal. But when you're introducing this. How are you suggesting that people partake? You know?

Tony Pham  59:06
So I think that what we'll do is, first, we give people a little pre reading before the session, and then the session is really when people learn about the techniques first, and then after that is the home kind of work where people do their own practice, so they use these audio recordings on their own, whereas before in the session, you know, you have the facilitator essentially walking people through what essentially is this audio recording. But this audio recording exists so that you yourself in your own time, say when you're waking up or going to bed, you can listen to these audio recordings, similar to some of those mindfulness apps, and use them to kind of guide you to to practice some of these skills about mindfulness and meditation. So I put the link in the chat. Maybe I'll give everyone around like five. Minutes to listen to it. And, you know, definitely listen to it for not just the, you know, the length, but the wording, the pacing, this, even the tone of the the person. Obviously, we're going to re record it and change it, but this is all from the original manual, so it'd be really nice to to hear, to get y'all to listen to this short five minute clip and then give me your thoughts. So I'll be quiet for now, and I'll, I'll, um, get back into talking about, let's say, five and a half minutes from now. You

Cynthia Jones  1:00:35
probably should give us about seven just so that. Okay, everybody. Okay, just seven

Tony Pham  1:00:41
minutes video, Okay, appreciate it.

Cynthia Cornelius  1:00:44
Okay, Thanks, You.

Cynthia Jones  1:07:01
Did I hear You say, take 10 minutes? Or what was that that you said? Or, let's,

Tony Pham  1:07:06
I guess, seven minutes, or something curious. How did everyone get a chance to listen to it?

Cynthia Cornelius  1:07:20
Yeah, oh, it just ended for me. Yeah, okay,

Doris Jackson  1:07:24
alright,

Tony Pham  1:07:27
yeah. So what are your thoughts? Obviously, that wasn't my voice or No, Miss voice, but also we didn't record that. But yeah, good things you thought about it, bad things you thought about it.

Cynthia Cornelius  1:07:45
For me, I think it was good. It was very detailed. And usually for me, it's hard for me to stay with something like that. However, it wasn't like a meditation type thing. It was a moving thing, like when you're moving, or when you're walking, to think about each step. Think about when one foot is up and the other goes down. The toes are very detailed and very, very mindful. And I did go through a mindful thing with Dr Ryan mace, as you may know, and so I'm, I'm very mindful lately, of a whole, I mean, since then, of a whole lot, but just going through that. Just make sure aware of what your body goes through, and you don't even recognize it. You just go through the normal walking and don't recognize, you know, your body movements, it's just something that comes natural to you. So I think it was rather relaxing and and, and put me back in my mind for mindset, for that seven minutes, for that five minutes and 23 seconds, because it seemed kind of long, but you know, it's because of the detail of each piece of moving your foot and your leg and your this, and your that, and yeah, so I like it

Tony Pham  1:09:08
awesome.

Cynthia Jones  1:09:09
Well, my thoughts may be different than everybody else's.

Tony Pham  1:09:13
Go for it.

Cynthia Cornelius  1:09:14
It's okay.

Cynthia Jones  1:09:18
Someone did not enjoy that.

Tony Pham  1:09:20
Yeah, yeah, what were your thoughts?

Cynthia Jones  1:09:23
Well, for I don't know. Maybe because I, you know, I just went in kind of blindly, you know, with no expectation, and not really, when it said body scan, I was thinking something totally different. I didn't even know that it was about walking until we were halfway through,

Tony Pham  1:09:42
yeah. I think I mislabeled it. Actually, it was mindful walking, yeah.

Cynthia Jones  1:09:47
And the in the the tone, for me, the tone was too plateau, way too low. And I'm like, I don't even know what you want. Me to do and all this back and forth, and maybe if I had mindful training and all that stuff previously. But if we're talking about having people to come in and may not have had anything, I was kind of like, I don't even know what she's talking about. What she What does she want me to do? Just not having a picture to see what she was doing, and I have to listen to figure out what she wants me to do. I was like, that's way too much. That's for me. Like, I lose interest if I have to figure out what you're trying to tell just tell me what you need for me to do. And let's you know, less engaged or or what have you. But yeah, so I was, I was just kind of lost her. Her voice was too monotone for me, and I understand the the peacefulness and all that, but it just it wasn't engaging enough. I think that. I think that, considering that this program is for people of color, right? Not that the person has to be of color, but we tend to have some kind of, some type of range, some type of that captures movement. Yeah, yeah. I just anyway, that's, that's my that's, I felt like the language is was a little bit too advanced for just basic, lift your foot and mind it and roll it back and forth. I was like, someone's going to fall down like that. If we're talking about the seniors and what you're telling them to do, they're going to get the wrong idea. That's what I was thinking. I'm like telling me to just stand up and move my foot back and forth. I would have to be stable to do that, and making sure I'm holding on to something. And all those things have to be explained before someone actually tried to embark on it. Anyway, I'm done.

Tony Pham  1:12:01
I love it. I love it. Honestly, I think I really resonate with some of those things. I am also someone who prefers a bit more, I guess, like color in the voice kind of going, like, up and down and having different tones. It could be because I'm Vietnamese and our language is, like, actually tonal. You have to, like, be specific about your tones. And yeah, I could see it also being a little dry, not just in terms of the voice, but also the wording. And I think that, you know, huge innovation of this program is really trying to bring some of these skills to people who normally would not want to or have not engaged with them. So I think your point about, you know, rethinking how we even phrase some of these sentences, how we voice them, might bring in more people who could benefit from the basics of mindfulness and meditation. Cool, cool. Other thoughts,

Cynthia Cornelius  1:12:59
can I say, Thanks, Cynthia, I love hearing that, and that's a piece that I hadn't thought about. You know, some of it not a thing back. May seem kind of slow, like, why are you wanting me to walk so slowly? Maybe it needs to be faster movement. But can I just say, from one of the mindfulness sessions I went through for these guided recordings or guided meditations, or what have you i i felt that some of the male voices resonated, not resonated, but were more acceptable or peaceful for me. And that's just me. But I'm wondering if any of these recordings are in male and some in female. Is because we learn that, you know, some people prefer either, you know, not all female, not all male, but just it comes across differently depending on, you know, the gender. So I'm just wondering.

Tony Pham  1:14:00
So that's definitely interesting, because it also plays into some conversations we've had in the past about gender, because we do want to make this program inclusive for both men and women. And you know, we've even gotten the feedback that it might even make more sense to have this program almost separated based on like men and women. I don't know if we'll be able. We'll get the clearance for that, so probably not. But I do think that the gender the voice will be interesting to think about, not just if we do think about men versus women and what voices they might prefer as calm and relaxing, but also just in general, men and women. I don't know. Actually, I didn't think the majority of the recordings are probably female, because a lot of the practitioners are female. Oh, just wondering,

Cynthia Cornelius  1:14:54
yeah, just wondering about the recordings. What I would say for the groups I, I, for me, I the. Don't think I would like just one gender. I think if you can get a mixed, you know, male and female, because we can learn from each other that way, so

Tony Pham  1:15:11
we can divvy it up, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cynthia Cornelius  1:15:13
Okay. Thanks.

Tony Pham  1:15:17
Any other thoughts,

Cynthia Jones  1:15:19
I just wanted to agree with what Cynthia was saying to probably because both of our name is Cynthia, that's probably why. But maybe what, what you're what you were hearing was tone like the the male, yet they have a different tone that's kind of usually a little bit higher than a woman's right? And the pitch is a little bit different. But I like that kind of the variations, even if you use something like that, but be able to kind of break it up and have that mixture so that all everyone's needs are met. And I don't think that there's a need to separate the male from the female. I think that there's something that we get from one another, and we hear from one another, even in a group and in a room, that may not happen with just a male group or just a female group. So, right, yeah.

Anne  1:16:08
So

Tony Pham  1:16:09
I think I would like that, both in terms of, yeah, the cross talk possibility, and also logistics, it's easier if we just have a kind of a mixed group, okay? And then also, I guess while listening to y'all, it made me think about how I should probably introduce a slide from some of these other questions in my head, such as, you know, we've we've definitely brought up a few terms throughout this manual, some of which are like mood and feeling down. But I'm curious, you know, because, to be honest, I've, we've tried to avoid using the word depression when thinking about, you know, people feeling down. And I'm curious, um, if that may have been too, too much like should, is depression an okay word, or is it better to use other terms, like, yeah, feeling down or feeling unhappy or feeling sad,

Doris Jackson  1:17:05
why it is what it is. I mean, yeah, if you're feeling down and depressed, I mean, you say it, that's how, yeah, um, when I was when I heard from her what Cynthia was saying that, like she was too soft with her voice this, she was saying, Do this, do that, do this. And I'm saying, I can't catch up, it was, like a little confusing. So I have to see then to yeah, there wasn't a picture.

Tony Pham  1:17:43
Yeah. I think that's interesting too, because I wonder if it might be alleviated if people attend the session first and so they can see others, including the instructor, do it. The other idea is we could just make it a video, and then also include, like an audio version in place. People, for some reason, want that. But yeah, that would be nice. And I think it would maybe make it feel less like disembodied or something, even if they've already attended the session and might need it like a refresher to see and hear cool. And then

Cynthia Cornelius  1:18:22
I think just the word, the word depression, needs to be used, because I agree with Doris. Call it as it is. Some people are really quick and mindful to tell you that they're dealing with depression. I suffer from this. I suffer from depression. And because they're seeking help. They're seeking coping mechanisms. They're seeking so I think it's fine to use it. Those are just my thoughts. Thanks.

Cynthia Jones  1:18:52
Make sure that we're incorporating all that so the words that you were using and the depression, so that way it encompasses everyone. Just in case people aren't at that level. We don't want them to think that it's not for them. Or if someone's that way, if you put it all there, then it kind of engages everybody.

Tony Pham  1:19:13
Yeah, I was thinking that too, actually, while I was listening to y'all, because I feel like it might be confusing if we don't kind of touch upon the various ways that we may talk about our mood, whether in a super clinical context, like the word depression or something more, more colloquial that we might use on the street or something. And then, you know, I think that, you know, when we do these recordings, we may also try to bring in other practices that are kind of like mindfulness adjacent, like prayer, or at least inviting people to to engage in those practices, if it might make them feel more comfortable thinking, will probably include it as part of like the video instruction as. When we kind of orient people, but maybe in the audio to just be strictly like what's going on and what people are doing, okay? And then when it comes to terms like mindfulness and meditation, we've kind of been using them, but also mindful that maybe some people might not like them, have they kind of sounded okay in the context of, you know, the snippets we've been sending out, or even, like, the file names and so forth.

Cynthia Cornelius  1:20:25
I'm not following, are you talking? You're saying something about prayer. Can you say? Oh,

Tony Pham  1:20:30
yeah. So the first thought I was saying was that, you know, we are also mindful, that, you know, when we think about meditation and mindfulness, that it's not simply that typical picture of someone sitting cross legged on stool, but maybe it's, you know, what we might do in our cultural practices, or in our community practices of being intentional and being mindful of a higher power of praying to God and praying to Jesus, and I and I wonder, I think it would be interesting, because We've heard people say that's important, and we can try to incorporate that in in the either the video or the audio recordings, to remind people that, you know, it's not just like a one type of meditation kind of thing. You know, there's other types of meditation. And it's not, you know that again, that typical picture of like a Buddhist monk or something sitting somewhere, and then the other thought, yeah, okay, no, no, I, I'm I'm listening. Yeah,

Cynthia Cornelius  1:21:31
I think that would be okay to use that suggestion or as a recording that people can click on or not. Some people aren't in with prayer. Some people don't, you know, some people don't. Some so I wouldn't make it like a mandatory thing, maybe just an option, or just say, Okay, let's pray. You know, nothing like that is just as an option for them to click on. But I think Tony, it's key to to capture, you know how people like you said introduction, the freshman orientation, the introduction, when people are sharing or introducing themselves, the facilitator, take those words, capture those words, write down those words, and that way you can use them back, and you'll know what to say. You know, somebody may say depressed, somebody may say they have the seasonal disorder, you know, some people may say they're have anxiety. Get what they saying, and that way you'll know what to use back. And as Cynthia said, then they they can feel included, you know, that way. So that's just a suggestion, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Tony Pham  1:22:38
Thank you, yeah. And we can definitely do that. I think that with the pilot, we'll be trying to take notes too about, you know, how people interact with the program and what works and what doesn't work. And I never thought of it that way, but it would be nice to keep a catalog of how people are themselves, choosing to talk about, you know, the conditions of, say, chronic pain and depression, and get a sense of, like, what are the most common ways that people say it, so that we're not excluding people either. And as far as going back to the prayer actually, you know, I really like their Thursday groups, like praying. I love those. Honestly. They're really powerful, and I feel like people really connect over them. And I'm curious, you know, when you think about a program like this, do you think people would want to pray into or think that might be too much, given the more of the formality of this type of thing?

Cynthia Cornelius  1:23:28
I just speaking from my Thursday group. I think it's, it's a thing that we do, and we we started from the beginning. We some people. We have had people that didn't want that. Oh, I thought this was a recovery group. I thought this was support group. Why you all praying? Well, they were, they were against it, and we, we let it be known that that's what we because a lot of us are very spiritual. So for a group like this that may not want to be the basis of it, because it may, you may lose people not saying that you will. But I know a lot of the people that attend the groups that that we have, love praying. Uh, you may want to somewhere like you said, bring in talking. You know, would anyone want to share about their higher power, and kind of get, okay, what, what their higher power is, and then you can go from there to, you know, invite them to share about it, or give suggestions to the group when. But I don't think I would make it a basis, a base part of the program, because that may be a bit of a turn off to some for our group, turn off to you, then this group isn't a good fit. But that's not what you want. You want this to work for your audience. So, yeah. So those are my thoughts.

Tony Pham  1:24:52
Yeah, I love that. It's tricky, because I definitely appreciate also how you like gently go into praying and you. Know, it's like, Oh, you don't have to. We just do this.

Cynthia Cornelius  1:25:03
And we have a disclaimer too, like, we're going to pray in, you know, we ask someone to pray and we're going to, we have a disclaimer, if you don't want to partake, you know, just kindly mute yourself for about five minutes, and we'll let you know when we're done that kind of thing. But, but that's just what, what works for our group. So, yeah,

Tony Pham  1:25:21
yeah, no, but I really do take a lot of inspiration from what's already been going on. In many ways y'all are already doing this kind of stuff, but definitely, we'll try to take the middle ground from what you're saying, you know, not like, try to really shoehorn it in, but give people the space to talk about it if they want and try to have everyone be open minded if other people want to talk about their faith or their their purpose. Cool beans, I would love to go through the other recordings, but I think we basically got a gist of it from that one, because they're all kind of similar, but they just are with different things, like there's a seat of meditation and the focus on the breath so we can definitely keep this feedback in mind when we're re recording and redoing these pre recorded audio clips. And then let's see, is my screen frozen? No. Okay, so I misspelled practice. Sorry about that. So there's other aspects to this program too, some of which I'm not super excited about, but I think is kind of part and parcel for any kind of behavioral program, which is the idea of, like, homework. And so, you know, people will go to these sessions, they will do the work, like in the session, obviously participating talking. But I think that, like with the intro, there's good evidence to suggest that, you know, these skills are hard to maintain if you don't do them at home too, and so, or think about them too in terms of like, doing some of these exercises. So like, you know, here's one exercise sheet that came with the original program. And here, this is about mindful eating. So it says this week, as you did in session, bring awareness and sensations as you are eating. Do this during at least one meal or snack each day. Notice your thoughts, emotions and behaviors, actions you take or want to take, and then in the table below, which will print people out like a copy of these handouts, write down a few notes about what you notice, sensations, thoughts, emotions during the activity. Another one, this is a body scan meditation each day this week, starting the day after session two, find a place where you can lie down comfortably without being disturbed. Follow the instructions on the audio track, and then again, write down a few notes about what you noticed during the activity in that table below, and rate how aware you were of your judgments, of your experience. Again, this is sort of home practice of some of the things that have already been covered during the session that preceded it. Let's see. I think I have another one, very similar. Again, mindfulness of a routine daily activity. Again, similar. Choose a different activity than the one you did last week. Practice awareness of your physical sensations and so forth, and then write down your notes, rate, how where you were, your judgments, and yeah, I'm just curious in general, not just the specifics of these examples, but I'd really like to think about how we can make the homework more engaging and more, I don't know, more appealing, because I do worry that people are busy and they may not have the bandwidth to do these kinds of things at home. But maybe I'm wrong. I'm curious what you all think, and if you have any ideas about how we can make it Yeah, more appealing, more engaging.

Anne  1:28:42
I think that

Cynthia Jones  1:28:45
this will, some will, and some won't. Don't make it as some mandatory, because then you're it may be too much of a higher expectation, I see encourage some to All right, let me at least do the some of this stuff. You know, it may encourage people during the week to do something just so that they can record it, but then you have it so that, hey, this is for you to be mindful of you. But we want to hear when you come back to the next class. We want to hear from everyone, what did you come up with? But they may have not did it every day, but maybe they did it once that week or twice that week, something and would like to share with the group. So just kind of a little bit of accountability, but not to the point where, all right, every week you all asking me to, you know, it's become a full eight weeks every day. Yeah, every day. But it's really by choice. You know what I

Tony Pham  1:29:41
mean? Yeah, okay, okay, I like that. Um,

Cynthia Jones  1:29:45
can I put one more thing out there? Um, this goes way back to the beginning, right? But I wanted to put this out there for for people to think about and or whatever. Um, if you want to have a conversation, you asked about the. Name. And as I was some things just kept coming. Oh, yeah, in my mind about possibility of a change of names, and I'll throw this out. And you all can either throw it out or you can, well, can

And there's going to be a few focus points that I want to zero in on, because there's just so many things that we need to take into account when we're making this program.

and we're just doing an introduction. So if you want to say name where you're from and a fun fact about yourself,

Blanca  13:49
hi everyone, my name is Blanca Gomez. I'm from Roxbury. Fun fact, I'm a daredevil so I'm trying to do my skydiving soon enough. So that's on my bucket lists.

Tony Pham  14:08
I thought it was taco salad, I'm so sorry I messed up. I messed up, but you got the seven hills Scrambler? Right? Yes, okay, I got one right. Sorry. We also got some other sandwiches, I think, like turkey sandwiches, like french fries.

Unknown  14:35
Did you get mine wrong, too?

14:48
No, no, let's see. Oh, so that so I did get that one wrong, because I asked them for that. They said they didn't have the haddock, unfortunately. So I actually, I think I ordered like some kind of like crab sandwich. I don't know if this might be it. Sorry. It was kind of chaotic when I was ordering. There shouldn't be any pork in there. Let's see only the scramble had some bacon.

Miguel  15:15
Tony, I texted you just a steak and cheese.

Tony Pham  15:20
I messed up, I messed up.

Unknown  15:22
This is not it. Sorry, I didn't get the Pepsi.

Tony Pham  15:29
Yeah, my apologies. We got, we got the taco salad right here. Are you sure I appreciate you about that again? Let me get you some forks.

Unknown  15:55
Thank you for doing your best.

BLANK  16:00
(Continued conversation about food)

Tony Pham  16:28
We have a new one too. Name where you're from and fun fact about yourself.

Miguel  16:34
Fun fact?

Tony Pham  16:35
Yeah, favorite color, favorite place you've been to...

Miguel  16:38
My name is Miguel Gomez. I grew up in Dorchester. Fun fact for me is I like to do it all.

Tony Pham  16:47
okay, that's good.

Miguel  16:48
You tell me, let's go.

Unknown  16:58
So Are y'all married?

Blanca  17:00
Yes

Miguel  17:01
for 17 years.

Tony Pham  17:27
Alright, y'all, well, I'm going to kind of focus this in a little bit. So as you know, we're making this like mindfulness and meditation and talk therapy program for folks with chronic pain and periods where they're feeling down or low about, you know, life in general, or their pain condition. But what I'd like to focus in on, in particular with this group is an issue that we were told to get more feedback on, and it might even be relevant here, and it's about gender. We talked a little bit about this in the other group, but one thing that I think is important is understanding how gender can play a role when it comes to chronic pain or feeling down. And yeah, I thought I'd just start us off there. I don't know if folks have opinions when it comes to say, especially say in the black community, how gender may play a role in how we express ourselves, how we express our pain, how we seek care, how we talk about things like depression. Yeah, so if anyone maybe has experiences from their life or experiences they've heard in others, where, you know, men and women, especially in the black community, have differences in this capacity, anyone want to start us off?

Unknown  19:01
You mean as far as gender?

Tony Pham  19:03
Yeah, I can give an example too, just because I run some of these groups, I've been told again, I'm not a black man, but I've been told that black men tend to be what they call, like stoic, like they don't show their emotions as much, they don't share how they're feeling as much if they have pain or if they're feeling depressed, they don't bring it up as much as say, maybe Black women do. And you know, again, I'm not saying that's fact or fiction, but I do know that's something that we were hoping to explore, especially as we create this program and we try to make it as accessible and acceptable as possible, so yeah, like even that, or other other dynamics too, when it comes to gender and like pain and mental health.

Timmy  19:53
Yes, to the only three people of color in the room. Yeah, I've been blessed, I guess. I'm 62 years old, so I've been blessed where I haven't had many medical concerns or medical issues. But, you know, of late, when I noticed things or things, you know, catch my attention, I always check in with a doctor or whatever. Yeah, because, you know, I have uncles that recently passed, and they were relatively young, you know, yeah, late 60s, early 70s. Yeah, I'm very conscious of it, so I have no problems if I feel uncomfortable, I go. Yeah, I go, and I might go twice, because I don't trust one. So, you know, yeah, I always check, yeah, yeah, always, yeah.

Unknown  20:53
I know we're pressing for time, but can everybody go around real quick and say their names please? Thank you.

BLANK  21:43
(Participants saying names again)

Tony Pham  21:53
Oh, okay. And you know, going back to what you were saying, Have you noticed any differences, like with other black men in terms of how they might seek care or talk openly about issues that they're facing, like medical issues, stuff mental health issues.

Timmy  22:11
Well, I don't, I don't want to speak, you know, generalization, but I do have, you know, personal experience with family members, yeah, and I'm having a hell of a time with one of my uncles. Yeah, you know -

Unknown  22:24
to go to the hospital?

Timmy  22:25
Well, not go to the hospital, yeah, well, go to hospital, yeah and him expressing what his issues are and what he needs help with. And I tell him, I'm not going to sit around and hang out with you and watch you die. But I when we talk, that's the contention. You know what I mean? Because I'm saying, what is it you need, or what is it you want to do, or blah blah blah? But he just refuses to. He got nurses coming by twice a week, yeah, but he won't say anything, he says everything's fine. Can't even go from the bedroom to the bathroom without running out of breath, you know. So, how was that fine? So, you know?

Soraya  23:03
Yeah, I had a cousin and a grandmother that was like that. I guess she didn't want me to worry about her. And she moved away with her sisters, and I found out she had cancer, and she ended up passing away down there, yeah, I don't like the way they did it, but that's just, she was here all her life with us. She was around us, even when my mother passed, yeah, and then she moved down there with her sisters, and that was it. And then my cousin, he had pancreatic cancer, not pancreatic. What is it, prostate? It went away, and when it came back again, he never told us. Mm, next thing you know, they found him in his house. So it's like, people don't - he's been going to the hospital and stuff, but he wasn't letting the family know, and that's the thing about it. And then when he passed, he was on his own, yeah, by himself, and we could have been there to support him. And my cousin, same thing, brain cancer, lung cancer, yeah, so I have people that passed that didn't tell me nothing, and then you find out after, and it's really sad.

Tony Pham  24:18
Can you say your name right before you talk.

Leah  24:23
But, I think with that, I'm sure that a lot of people do not want to be a burden, and they don't want to depend on people. That's why I think they don't share, especially when it comes to mental health. Mm, yeah, because my boyfriend, he's, I feel like he needs mental health. So when we talk to the doctor, because I go with him and I say it, because I'll ask, you know, and he'll say, no, no, no, but I see the change since he's had COVID. Because he had long COVID. Yeah, that he's different. And it doesn't hurt to talk to someone, they don't know that. You know, it's just a stigma that goes with that meant to him. You know, when they think the word mental isn't it, it's not necessarily for the mental it's, you know, your mental health is to -

Tiawanna  25:22
beciause people label it

Leah  25:23
exactly

Tiawanna  25:24
It's a labeling thing. That's why a lot of time, people don't tell them that they have these problems because they think they're going to be labeled,

Leah  25:31
because they think that they're going to be labeled, and then they don't want to be the burden. Because my father had prostate cancer too, and lung cancer, and he always act like he wasn't in pain. But then he didn't take his pain meds, you know, and then he wouldn't let a visitor nurse come. He didn't want them in the house. And my brother was supposed to be taking care of him, but he did not do a good job at all. He was diabetic so he had to take insulin too, and he just didn't wake up one day. But for him to deny that, plus, I tried to get him to come back up here too -

Unknown  26:10
No, he wasn't here

Leah  26:11
No, and when you're down south, those people definitely are not going to the doctor because, not just because they don't have a file, they don't believe in preventive health, because it's probably not the health care. But everyone I knew there was sick, they would just go to the emergency room all the time. Next thing you know, they're dead because they didn't do any preventive health. They didn't go through the doctor.

Tony Pham  26:39
I see. Do you think that was similar for your relative, the one you mentioned who you've been trying real hard to get stuff like, was it like stigma?

Timmy  26:48
My uncles that passed, they were, you know, very connected to medical care. They just passed, yeah, you know. But the one, one of them that's still alive, I think he's 76 or something like that, maybe 75-76. He's just, you know - my mother just told me to wash my hands, you know, trying to care, you know, without me getting too frustrated, you know, yeah. Because, like, I say, he got nurses coming, so just tell the nurse what the issue is, yeah, and let them work it out. You know, to help with all that home care, home remedy stuff, yeah. So we go through everything.

Unknown  27:34
Does he tell the nurses and stuff?

Timmy  27:35
No, no, no, no. He tells them he's fine, you know, yeah, we go through it on a regular.

Tony Pham  27:43
I see

Timmy  27:43
and that's what I'm dealing with, because I don't have any problems going to the doctor. Yeah. I mean, you know, even if you don't agree with the diagnosis or the care, at least you got an opinion. And then we go get another one, you know, and see where you go, you know. But he just won't do it. But that's maybe his generation, because, you know, all his friends are gone. Yeah, you see what I'm saying. So he doesn't expect to live much longer, you know? So I don't know, I don't want to say he's giving up, but, you know, it is what it is. You know,

28:17
I think a lot of people don't want to know if they've got that. If you know what's going on, and you know if you get depressed or whatever. Yeah, it makes you sicker, and it makes you depressed, and it makes you not wanting, you know, to want to thrive.

Participant #3  28:37
but if you don't know, you can't take care of it. So -

Soraya  28:39
and a lot of them don't want to, yeah,

Leah  28:41
They don't want to know that.

Maria  28:46
But they do find out something's happening all the time too. Giving me this medicine, and now next two months later, you're telling me there's nothing else you can do for me. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not going to go through that, that's for sure. Imma be just like one of those people, I'll go to the doctors, but they ain't going to poke and cut and give me all this medicine. I'm gonna do my exercise and imma do, you know, I go get the three opinions and everything. But sometimes something don't sound right to me, I don't have that education, but this is my body. I've been in this body, how many years? I know when something's wrong with me. So if you can't take care of me today, and you ain't got an appointment for me for nine or 10 months, this is important to me. We need to know, not in nine and 10 months. And then you gotta see this one to ask you questions, and then you gotta get another appointment to find out what it is. All these tests. No, we need to do that today, and then I will have time to do it today. So you know, your mind goes, you know, you're like, something's wrong. You know they want me to see a specialist, but they ain't got appointment for nine months. And then they sending you stuff, somebody taking new patients. You can't even get an appointment. You can't even get an appointment.

Tony Pham  30:15
You mentioned generation, like with your uncle, you know, being a different generation. I'm curious, you know some of it.

Timmy  30:20
No, I can also go a step further. Yeah, my father, my father passed at 50 from tumors, brain tumors, and he operated twice. The third time, you know, when it came back, he said, I'm not doing. He wasn't doing and t took him. Yeah, you know, I don't know, like, I said, it may be generations where people don't trust doctors, or even doctors dont want to go through it, but some people make those decisions.

30:53
Yeah, I'm curious also, like, you know, like, maybe it's like lack of trust, or maybe it's like feeling wronged in the past. But is it culture-

Timmy  31:04
we're not expecting, because you gotta be well, you may not remember, but there's been a time where black men didn't have a long life expectancy.

Tony Pham  31:12
Oh, okay,

Timmy  31:15
so well before covid.

31:18
Our trust for the health community is zero.

Timmy  31:28
I trust, I trust.

Leah  31:32
We just don't trust. COVID exposed it again that lack of trust. Why no one wanted to get the vaccine and stuff, because they have experimented on us, you know what I'm saying?

Unknown  31:51
They found out that in the museum, that the doctor experimented and then the other doctor who worked with him knew he was doing wrong. Yeah, they helped him with it. And they have their names, a few of the names because

32:09
that was a long time ago.

Joanne  32:21
say your name just for the microphone?

32:24
Joanne, trust God. Trust somebody. God sent the doctors in lawyers. So you got to trust somebody

Leah  32:34
But sometimes they want to take the shots so they can get paid.

Timmy  32:39
And then we say trust. Yeah, we say trust, but it may be faith. It may be faith in the system or faith in the person. It might not be trust. It might be you have faith in the person doing the right thing.

Anita  32:55
But all the medications they give, all the medications they give it, they give it to you for one thing, and it causes something else so you should always read the side effects. That's what I don't like. And they're just making money.  Now, years ago, the roots and all this everything out of the ground is what took care of us when we were kids. And that's what my mother believed, and she didn't go give us all that medicine from the pharmacy all the time, you know. So some of that stuff is still good. People use that stuff today and it helps. Yes, and the medicines are made out of it, but they're making money off of it, yeah, you know. And so I just don't take all the medicine, you know, that they want to offer. I just don't. I don't eat right, but I work out. Haha I eat what I want to eat.

Tony Pham  33:48
I want to pass the microphone over to here, because I know I haven't heard from y'all, but was there anything else y'all wanted to say? Or Yeah.

Sandra  33:55
I think, in our fairness, from as far as I know, growing up parents and so that we don't used to really talk about stuff. And the present life, now you get to learn about what depression is and anxiety and a lot of things that I'm like ADHD, whatever that is, yeah, probably was back then, but you didn't know anything about it, yeah. I think if there was a label, I probably could have been one of the people that had Attention Deficit Disorder. But look where I am today. You know, you don't give up just because you hear things or you don't know what it is. You try and you do things to help yourself and others. So I think it is though, because a lot of us, or a lot of people back then didn't know stuff.

Pearlita  35:01
If you say something,  -

Tony Pham  35:12
did you say your name right?

35:15
My name is Phyllis. I guess if you acting funny, they would just label you as mad or insane, but now we know it's name on it for mental illness, and it can be from different things. I, for one, am not a doctor's person. I go once a year for my physical, and I think that's enough that they want me to come back every two months. I don't make a part of my routine.

Unknown  35:45
But how you feel?

Phyllis  35:49
I feel fine! I have the blood pressure, all that. Do that at home, yes, but as you said, it makes money for them if you go every two months,

Maria  36:04
yeah, yeah, that's true. But you need to go every and find out, yeah, then make the decision what you're going to do about it, you know. So you're healthy, if you go once a year, yes, ma'am!

36:27
(food talk) somebody may have taken it. I'm sorry

Participant #3  36:30
If you don't mind. I like to get to your number before we leave, because I used to drink because I've been procrastinating instead of getting back into it. Yeah?

36:50
Also on the YouTube, there are videos, yeah,

Timmy  36:56
no, I know YouTube and all that I know I do too, no, and I'm a visual learner.

Tony Pham  37:22
we got a new person. Do you want to say your name?

Arneechia  37:37
Hi, baby,

Tony Pham  37:39
like, where you're from and a fun fact about yourself,

Arneechia  37:46
okay, yeah,

Tony Pham  37:48
like a favorite color or something people don't know about you often.

Arneechia  37:53
I like purple and pink.

Tony Pham  37:55
Okay, that's good combo. So we were just, we're just talking about kind of like how people, especially in the black community, express themselves when it comes to chronic pain, depression, how that influences seeking care, and also thinking about how gender differences, like black men versus black women, and how that might play out when it comes to seeking care

Leah  38:20
I don't think black men sometimes they don't go as they should. Black men, I think they, some of them they probably go too much.

Tony Pham  38:39
Yeah when you say, go, too much. Could you say more on that?

Leah  38:43
They're always at the doctor, more than black women I think.

Tony Pham  38:50
Really? Why do you think that is?

Leah  38:54
I don't know, just being nurturers and trying to keep care of themselves, because they know other people are probably relying on them. They want to make sure that they can take care of their business.

Tony Pham  39:15
I see. Yeah, sorry yall, Miss Cynthia is going to say something

Cynthia  39:27
Hey, I've just been listening to everyone and a lot of what's being said kind of resonates with me. You know, in my opinion,I'm from the South - from North Carolina. I remember my ancestors, not really, not normally just sick. And once people get sick, you know, they pass away quickly. You wouldn't even know that they were constructing on a certain thing. And I think part of it may be a fear of being labeled, especially if it's mental health stuff, even though mental health stuff is being more prevalent now, out in the open, because there's so many cures that that's being offered. But I know a lot of our ancestors didn't want to be a burden on us, so they wouldn't tell what was going on with them. You know, a lot of them trust in the Lord that things going to be alright. You know, they had soulmate remedies that worked for almost everything, and it was except for, you know, severe diseases and stuff like that. So they just dealt with them. But, you know, and kind of like, when things got diagnosed, it seems like you just passed away quickly once you knew what, you know, you were dealing with, cancer or dealing with what have you. But I think thirdly, the gender piece of it. Men, you know, back in the day, they didn't, they didn't come forward or go to the doctor as often, they just dealt with whatever. I don't know if it was like a macho saying "I can deal with this", or if they would be viewed this being weak if they, you know, went to the doctors. But women are more open, and always have been more open to seek help. I'm really happy that today in this society, that a lot of our men are opening up and being more upfront and taking care of themselves, and don't feel that it's weak, you know, to speak about when they're sick or going to the doctors and as opposed to our ancestors, our older family members. So I see the difference in, you know, back in the days, and currently, in this day and age, I think more men are going to the doctors once a year, not putting it off for every five years and every three years. So I appreciate hearing what everyone had to say. A lot of it resonates with me and my ancestors and my older family members that have passed on so good to be here and thanks for listening.

Tony Pham  42:02
Thank you for that.

Genie  42:03
I umm... I wanted to say something. I have both sides, there's men that I know that are really active with their health, and they go to the doctors get their physical exams. Then on some side, I have men. Then on some side, there's men that I know that don't go to the doctor, and it's a struggle for them. You know, I have a grandson that has medical issues, but I just can't get him to go to the doctor. I mean... and it's a struggle for me, because I've pretty much always been an advocate about my physical health and, you know, being a breast cancer survivor, and I work with families, I work with women, you know, being an advocate for breast cancer, and it's difficult. I've worked with a lot of women that won't go to the doctor to get mammograms, and so it's just not men either. It's women too, because they're afraid of the unknown, and we have to stop being afraid of the unknown, because the only way we're going to get better and heal ourselves is to go and see what's going on. I just recently was like in a lot of pain the last couple of months, and I just got tired of being in the pain, and I went to the doctor. I said, I need some some help, because I'm sick and tired of being in pain. So because I had a, you know, a hip replacement and a knee replacement, and I got the bursitis in the hips, so I ended up getting cortisone shots on the right hip and the left hip, which gave which was a tremendous relief, because I was able to feel so much better, you know, mentally. You know, mentally, I was such a mess because I was just in so much pain. But actually, right now, I'm feeling a lot better mentally, because I'm not in that pain like that. So I just, I think people should just - like I go to the doctor all the time for everything. You know, I got a good doc on my medical team. They really good, they really take care of me. They really open. And I have a good relationship with my all my doctors. So I just think that we should just get out of that myth. Yeah, you know, because I have mental health issues, I have attention deficit disorder. I have post traumatic stress disorder. So I got a lot of stuff going on, and I used to be afraid to let people know that I had attention deficit and post traumatic but I'm okay with it now.

Unknown  44:37
May I ask your question? the hip thing. Do you walk with a cane?

Genie  44:43
No.

Unknown  44:43
After that?

Genie  44:44
No

Unknown  44:44
but you just was in a lot of pain?

Genie  44:46
I was in a - I would - just all the time.

Unknown  44:48
My girlfriend had that, and she's walking with a cane. But I'm going to tell them, what is that called, you said, they said it had a name?

Genie  44:54
It's bursitis.

Phyllis  44:59
So I want to piggyback off of what someone said, this young lady said. So therefore, there are people that used to run like that, likes to go to the hospital for attention seeking and stuff. At 13, I used to do that myself. And then when I found out, but I did find out I had a hernia, so I had to have surgery. So therefore it was good that I was running into a certain degree, but when they talk about operation, I didn't want to do it, but I was so young, so I still did it. And then there's people like my grandchildren's mom, who has Munchausen disease, which is attention seeking, and she would run to the hospital with the children to have them have all kinds of  tests and that was sad, because they were getting all these different things done lumbar functions, adenoids taken out, all these different things done to them for something that wasn't even wrong with them. And I'm glad that the hospital found that out, because the kid - now she's doing it to herself. She's been doing it to herself anyway, but yes, so that's why I have my grandkids now, and I don't know how it's going to affect them as they get older, but they were babies then, then nothing they could do. And yeah, so it's like a different thing, a double edged sword

Sandra  46:15
I seen that on a talk show, yeah, from the baby on up, and then the child got old enough and got tired of it. Nothing wrong with all the time,

Phyllis  46:28
I got all these tests away every single other week, I had to get the test on this, I had an MRI, I had all these. Now, some of the places don't want to do female test no more. If you haven't had something in so many years, they want you to come back in three years. No, I want to get tested every day like I supposed to. Don't tell me to wait until three years, because you never know what could pop up within there. And I guess that's what they're waiting on. But yeah, so it's just a lot of stuff going on that people don't, um, they don't tell you. And she says she got good doctors. I had a good doctor, and I think that's the reason that would help people more if they felt comfortable with the doctors. Because if you have doctors that just rush you in there and don't even touch you, what good is happening?

Genie  47:15
And you know what? It's okay to tell your doctor I don't like your treatment, and I'm gonna let you go, and I'm gonna find me somebody else. I don't have a problem with that, because they work for us. We don't work for them, and if they don't do what you need to do, you let them go. Tell them, I'm gonna find me somebody else. And I've done that recently on my eyes. Yeah, I kept going back and forth to the doctor. She kept prolonging my visits, and I said, "Enough is enough. Letting you go. Nothing personal", but I just don't think we're working together, right? So I had to let her go. So you know it's okay to say that. It's okay to say you're not treating it, right?

Multiple participants  47:54
Yeah, absolutely.

Genie  47:57
Because I'm a breast - I'm a cancer patient, and I'll tell the doctor in a minute, you're not going to have me come back in two years for a test. You're going to test me now because I'm a cancer patient.

Tiawanna  48:06
Yeah, you have to. patient.

Joanne  48:11
Anybody should be seen if they make an appointment, they need to be seen, not two months later!

Genie  48:18
Yeah, you're right, ASAP.

48:21
So I already got my list of appointments right, like that.

Tony Pham  48:26
I just want to do a check. Did you - were you about to say something? And just say your name real quick before

Anita  48:31
Anita, I grew up in a family where Illness was a state secret. (unable to hear the rest)

48:56
Yeah, you know, for me, a lot of times when I'm getting a medical history, sometimes it's hard, because there's a certain point in that generation that I am not going to expect any answers about, like grandfathers grandmothers. But for that also, I want to make sure that y'all got some time to talk if there was something that came up. But I also have some other things I was thinking too. You know, what a little elephant in the room, but there's a there's much more women here, right? I wanted to mention that because I also, you know, I'm not as plugged in to UCB as I used to be, but I also know that they're doing some initiatives to bring more men in. And I'm just curious, you know, when it comes to representation, say to like studies, coming to focus groups like this, or just kind of like what we're talking about, getting care, like, why do you think there are more women here than men? Sorry, sorry. I'll start over there.

Joanne  49:59
My name is Joanne Sanders, men, I don't know, and I'm going to say our men, men of color. I know black men because I'm black, but they just don't go. Even at the center here -

Genie  50:14
Yeah, its all women

Joanne  50:15
where we go, our church groups -

Genie  50:20
All women

Joanne  50:26
but we go out to eat in these other places, and I'm going to tell you, it'd be more white men, yeah, bring them out. We do seafood. Black men, I don't know, like they just don't go. I was married for 37 years, my husband recently died 5 years ago from diabetes

Genie  50:48
Oh, my God, bless him

Joanne  50:52
he didn't go with me. He didn't want to go. I could excuse him because he was so much older. So he used to say, I done did that, done it? I got used to that, but they don't go.

Tony Pham  51:08
why do you think that

Joanne  51:09
I dont know!

Blanca  51:16
they just don't want to and I kind of relate, and I'm so sorry for your loss, because my husband is that way. I have to push him, and it got to a certain point, yes, so I now check myself. I have my ups and downs because of what my mother went through at one point, when before I lost her and whatnot. So I always go with the vibe. If I don't have a connection with that person or, you know, in the medical field, I'm going to be like Phyllis. I'm just going to be like, "You know what? I need another opinion. I don't feel a good vibe with you." But with my husband pace, he's always saying, can you make the appointment? I'm having this type of pain. I feel this type of pain. Okay, I make the appointment, but he doesn't go. So I got to a point I can't do this for you anymore, because I do see a pattern of, I guess some women have more health issue problems than a man does. I mean, it could be vice versa, but with him, he has a lot of issues, but he's not taking care of him the way he's supposed to. So I just let it go. I say, "You know what, if you don't make the appointment that's on you, because I can't."

Genie  52:36
Can I say something related?

Blanca  52:39
Yeah, that's the same thing. He does everything for my grandson. But when's the last time you did your physical, you know? So it's, it's a thing, and it's, you know, it's a cycle. But learn from your dad.

Tony Pham  52:55
What are your thoughts on this?

Miguel  52:57
Yeah, I always miss my appointment.

Tony Pham  53:00
Why is that?

Miguel  53:01
Because mental illness does not help

Maria  53:06
Oh, you just forget?

Miguel  53:10
No, no because my brain doesn't function like it used to when I was three.

Maria  53:18
Why don't you put it in yor calendar or in your phone?

Miguel  53:29
With my phone, I just, I just make phone calls and that's it, and watch movies.

53:35
do a task together -

Miguel  53:39
I asked her, she's frustrated, I'm not doing it. Yeah, I need help from you.

BLANK  53:55
(people talking over each other)

Genie  54:01
Can I say something real quick, not trying to bash you at all. Please try to go to the doctor, because I lost all my uncles young because none of them went to the doctors. And I might get emotional, but go to the doctor they because they could have prevented what happened to them, and by the time they did go to the doctors, it was too late. So try to try hard to remember.

Miguel  54:28
So you know what it is when they give me appointments, they give me appointments from well, I mean, I made my appointment last month and I have to wait five months, five months.

Blanca  54:44
And he gets frustrated from that.

Miguel  54:45
and I said, Do you have anything sooner?

Unknown  54:49
Go on the cancelation list, you'll get it.

Miguel  54:51
I need to get my kidney checked and the other one was the liver.

Maria  55:04
That's important.

BLANK  55:10
(people talking amongst each other)

Blanca  55:21
The new people that are coming in, for some reason, everything changes. Like it's not - the quality for service, for health service, is not there anymore.

Unknown  55:31
Just change, change hospitals, child.

Blanca  55:33
Yeah, that it would, you know, that they were like, with me and with him would be in the same kind of suggestion

Pearlita  55:42
There's a place called gather, yes, the new health. They are always reaching out to people. I mean, they're geared more for us, for people, than anybody. But they do a good job. They send transportation for you. Oh, wow. They come, you can go to other place. So Google gather they are good, yeah, in a lot of places now. I mean, they really do look out for you. So that's - After what you were, I had a husband for past, coming out five years now, so, but he was a man that I always did everything for. Yeah, you know, you get him to help do things for himself. But many things, cook, iron, he would do things like that. But otherwise, after work, because he was, like, nearly 15 years older than I was, but he wanted me to do everything, and I couldn't do that. I tried to get him to be independent if something happened to me.

Unknown  56:58
Yeah, it's like, you can't do it, I know!

Pearlita  57:01
you will wear out your partner, yes, and she wants you around right as much as you want her around so you don't try to take charge of you, or at least trying to show her, yeah, that you are trying for yourself, because

Leah  57:16
if you don't care about yourself, how can she?

Genie  57:20
I told the exact same thing, and it's not to the point, I'm so tired, yeah, I take care of him when he had covid, when I had my hip replaced.

Tony Pham  57:35
So I want to, I want to circle back to this, but I know Miss Cynthia has been very patient. And Miss Cynthia, by the way, if you want to say something, you should just say it, and then you can interrupt us, because you don't have to, you don't have to raise your hand.

Cynthia  57:49
Okay, I heard the young lady speak about Gather health, and I recently learned about Gather health. It started in Quincy, and now they have Columbia Road specializing PCPs, and they have all kinds of stuff. They give back to the patients, and they have events for the patients. And I think you have to be a certain age, but that was that I just wanted to mention, as some of you know, I co host a couple of groups weekly. For most of the time, we maybe have like 51 participants, and most of them are female. We may have five men out of that, which we welcome always. But I know nowadays there are a lot of men's groups, as opposed to what the way it used to be, you know, in the past. My question is, and maybe, you know, the men here today can kind of shed some light on that, if you, if you have something to say about it, is there an issue for a man to attend a group that's dominated by mainly females. I'm wondering if it's, you know, they don't want to open up in front of the female personal stuff, or maybe they feel that, you know, the women can resonate with what they're going through. Or, I'm not sure. I just always wonder about that. I know a lot of the men who do have a big participation, because it's all men there when it comes to mixed gender, it's only a handful of men. So what are your thoughts on that? Since we were talking about, you know, how few men there are versus females.

Sandra  59:32
But do you know if they open up among themselves in the man's groups? Do they?

Timmy  59:39
Yes

Genie  59:42
If it's all men, they do open up,

Timmy  59:43
yeah, yeah, yeah,

Genie  59:47
because it's all men, yeah.

Participant #3  59:49
But it's not like men seek out groups led by or run by, dominated by women, you know? I mean, I just have to be in this space and I don't mind because I've been in enough all men groups.

Multiple participants  1:00:05
right, right

Timmy  1:00:06
You know, I enjoy it

Leah  1:00:08
Is it because women were more emotional?

BLANK  1:00:13
(Participants talking amongst each other)

Miguel  1:00:15
No no no, y'all more dominant. Y'all more dominant y'all women.

Unknown  1:00:24
Somebody has to be dominant.

BLANK  1:00:27
(folks talking amongst each other)

Blanca  1:00:36
He said on my behalf, I am dominant.

Miguel  1:00:41
It's whatever she wants, she says she put a bad (couldn't hear) with me right now. You know what I mean?

Pearlita  1:00:51
Treat her right! Haha

Miguel  1:00:58
Everything gotta be for her. switch. If she says no, I don't want to do that, then no, no, no, no.

Pearlita  1:01:10
Because the woman we really make the decisions? We'll say what would you like. I don't know know, what do you want? You leave it all back to the woman

Miguel  1:01:22
because y'all don't listen

Genie  1:01:24
listen to one thing you will make your wife so happy, if you - no, I'm talking about your health, don't - yeah, you really need to honestly step out. Just step out and take care of yourself, man, because whatever's going on, there's so much treatments out there, and people don't think it is and I'm a living proof, because I've been through it. I might not look like I don't have any health issues, but I had them. But I made sure that I went to - thank you - I made sure I went to the doctor, and thank God I made it to 71 years so, you know, just step out on faith and man and take care of yourself, because you're gonna make her happy.

1:02:09
You might be able to dominate some things (laughing amongst group)

1:02:20
actually, I was talking with you about it, and I'm gonna keep this private, but you know, when we were talking just about stuff, you said something that was really interesting to me, and you said you appreciated me talking with you, coming from a man. And I was curious, could you unpack that? Or tell me more about that?

Miguel  1:02:36
Well, the doctors I've had before I wasn't comfortable with before, that's the reason why. The way you approach me, the way you speak to me, it makes feel more comfortable than my normal psychiatrist.

Tony Pham  1:02:54
Were they man, woman?

Miguel  1:02:56
she's a man, she's a woman, a woman. Well, I never met her.

Tony Pham  1:03:15
Let's assume she's a woman, yeah.

Miguel  1:03:16
Okay, so I opened up a little more with you, because you made me feel comfortable.

Tony Pham  1:03:22
I see

Miguel  1:03:23
That's what it's about, you know, to speak my mind, yeah.

Tony Pham  1:03:29
I see

Blanca  1:03:29
You just going to have that connection. Because even with me and her, I talked to her, but like I said, I've been looking to find someone else, because I met already in person. We do talk on the phone, but the way she talks to me, I feel like she feels like she's higher than me, and I'm like, no. Like there was one incident that, um, she had sent my medicine somewhere that I never go. It's either between Walgreens or CVS, those are the two pharmacies. And then, you know, I told her the last time I said, you know, Miss, no more CVS, I'm going to deal with Walgreens, because the medicine that I get, they don't have more over there. So I said, Walgreens. Okay, so she sent them somewhere else, and I'm calling and saying I never got my medication. Yes, you did. You picked them. I said, How are you going to tell me what I picked up? Or that I put it in the pharmacy that is listed. I was like, Okay, could you just let me know what pharmacy? And she was just, like, ranting and ranting, but higher pitched, and it got me to a certain point, because if you keep throwing stuff at me, I'm a person that - I am quiet, but I am quick to respond back too. So when I got quick to respond, I went to the left, let's put it that way. I went to the left, and she just put my anxiety up. And I'm like, No, you need to check your stuff, because I know what I'm saying. I said, I know I could be forgetful, but I know what I'm talking about on my medication. Come to find out, she sent it to down to a pharmacy I never go to.

Tiawanna  1:05:00
Oh my god.

Soraya  1:05:01
They did that to me too!

Phyllis  1:05:02
That is difficult.

Blanca  1:05:04
Then she finally sent it to the right one. And I'm like, maybe if you would hear me and send it to the right pharmacy, I would have been had my medication. Yeah, she sent it all somewhere else, but it's the way that she approaches the people, and she feels -

Leah  1:05:21
It's always about a presentation, that's why. But they did that - they sent it downstairs too, and they - it's the ones that answer the phone in the front, they don't listen. Yes, and she's trying to tell me blah blah blah, and they know me now, and I'm over the phone now telling them I'm -

Pearlita  1:05:56
No, you need to really check and do your due diligence and check so that's the thing

Leah  1:06:05
customers always right, which is the client. We are calling, you think we just want to call you and harass you. No, no, you did something wrong. Listen, or you'll never learn.

Tony Pham  1:06:19
And any of y'all, I just want to make sure, because I know sometimes it's hard when, like certain corners are talking. If there's anything you want to share, speak up. It's totally fine with us.

Leah  1:06:28
Can man ask you a question?

Pearlita  1:06:31
Yes

Leah  1:06:32
You said you was 94, right?

Pearlita  1:06:34
And healthy.

Leah  1:06:35
Okay. But my question to you is, I was told by an elderly couple once, maybe two years ago, that their doctor just took them off of all their medicine when they turned 80. Do you take medication now?

Pearlita  1:06:52
Yes I do, I take them everyday.

Leah  1:06:54
They said everything that just came off

Pearlita  1:07:00
I had open heart surgery 12 years ago.

Tony Pham  1:07:11
And you were about to say something, right? If it comes back, feel free.

Timmy  1:07:18
I'd like to go back to Cynthia's point. I think in terms of the gender difference in groups, I think like even participating in the group you run, you know, women have a tendency of talking about more wide ranging in general issues, whereas when groups of men get together, they're talking about specific situations, and usually it's, you know, dealing with discrimination or racism. And you know, the power dynamics, yeah, you know. So this is just, you know, participating in women's groups. It's just different, you know what I mean. And you might know, I don't speak much on the Zoom call

Cynthia  1:08:08
Okay I see your name I dont even see your picture on the call.

Timmy  1:08:12
Because half the time I got my shirt off, And I don't want to get no one excited.

BLANK  1:08:15
Participants laughing

Cynthia  1:08:24
Yeah we about to get excited.

Participant #3  1:08:33
It takes place in those type of environments where, you know, sometimes it's just good to listen, you know what I mean, you just, even if you don't speak, at least me, I don't have to speak to think. Yeah, you know, I hear things, and you just give me something to think about. You know, even if I don't act on it, at least I think about it. And then, you know, I have my aunt and I can beat her up with it, like you didn't hear them? Yeah, you know. But yeah, that's what I think it is, because the men groups that I've been a part of, you know, I take place in now, now kind of standoffish, because I just don't want to deal with the power issues that, you know, we tend to talk about. You know what I mean?

Tony Pham  1:09:19
Yeah. So you said you mentioned power issues?

Participant #3  1:09:23
yeah. Because, you know, as men of color, no matter how old we are, we're still trying to come up out of the, you know, discrimination, the beat downs, the incarcerations, the lack of education, the lack of health care. We are trying to come up out of a lot of things. And, you know sometimes you have to get forceful, aggressive or combative.  I'm saying that when you start talking about combative at my age, that's not trying to go to jail over the cause. Yeah, you see what I'm saying. No, I'm not going back, you know.  But that's what. It comes down to, you know, who's going to pick up the baton and who's going to continue to fight. And you know, it's one thing to discuss things, but just another thing to act on it. Yeah, you know, good example is people talk about the immigrants that's coming, particularly Haitians. And I'm saying God bless them, because, see, they told the administration, they told the power structure, we will shut down your hospitals, we'll shut down your bus stations, we'll shut down your airport and sleep right there on the floor until you find us a place to sleep. And now, all of a sudden, the shelters are opening up for them. Now we've been here, we've kind of got away from that, and we're not going to sacrifice to get those things. And just like I said, I'm not sacrificing prison again, you know, I mean to make a point or to, you know, no, no,

Tony Pham  1:10:57
That makes sense.

Sandra  1:10:57
Can I say something about the shelter piece? Not to bash anybody, but I've been in it so long, and we as color, we don't want to go in the shelter because we think we're all that. Not everybody, but a lot of - even my grandchildren, do not want to go in the shelter to make their lives better, right? Yeah, and the shelters are for everybody. They design these shelters for us, but we as people of color do not want to do it, and we gotta stop. Because you're entitled to this stuff. And I tell my grandchildren, what is wrong with you? The shelters are designed for everybody, but one thing I can say about the farming is they will go into these shelters so they can get what they want.

Timmy  1:11:42
But again, they'll shut down the airport, they'll shut down the hospitals.

Genie  1:11:44
When it comes to us, "Oh I'm not going into no shelter, No uh." They gotta stop it. Yeah.

Unknown  1:11:53
And then you get the person's that's caught you sleeping on the - (couldn't hear)

Genie  1:11:56
Yeah, exactly, we gotta stop! Because I was in the shelte too many, many years ago, and I was okay with it, humbling to myself, you know, my baby. I was like, I'm going in the shelter and give me some help, right? And I did it, so I was okay with it. So we got to stop saying, "Oh, I'm not going to do it, because they're going to talk about me."

Participant #3  1:12:21
And the thing is that there weren't that many beds available. You understand? Because if most of us have been here in Massachusetts, we're familiar with the mass and cass after they go from Island, and they were always talking about that out there, and the tents, blah blah blah, because they didn't have beds. But how come you can come up with 1000s and 1000s of beds for the immigrants? Because the immigrants said we'll shut down yourself, you know? And they did it!

Phyllis  1:12:58
Thank you.

Multiple participants  1:13:02
(Speaking on top of each other)

Tony Pham  1:13:02
Sorry sorry

Cynthia  1:13:03
- take them and put them somewhere sooner, because that, to them I'm thinking, that doesn't look good. We have all these people here and people coming through, traveling, and what does that look like for us as a city? But you're right, Tim, they did it.

Participant #3  1:13:17
Yeah. They have houses, they have housing, and they have a place to put their head, now, you know.

Unknown  1:13:21
and they stick together, yeah, yeah.

Tony Pham  1:13:24
Were you saying something?

Pearlita  1:13:25
I was saying that people don't want to follow rules too. Yeah? You can, if you need to. You can get your temporary shelter or whatever. But when it comes to following rules, everybody want to do it still -

Joanne  1:13:41
Yeah, you gotta be in them at a certain time.

Pearlita  1:13:42
And they don't want to listen so they forgot. I'm not saying yeah, I'm not.

Joanne  1:13:46
You're right.

Participant #3  1:13:49
Because those are people who are spoiled. You see, people who come from hardship, people who know hardship, people they know that this is lightweight stuff. Mm hmm, asking me to come in at 10 -

Timmy  1:14:00
when I don't have a roof over my head. Yeah, easy. Like you say, following the rules. And I'm saying that. You know people who've had hardships know that that's easy. You know what I mean? So you know those who haven't, they think, "who the hell are they to tell me, people telling me to come in at 10 o'clock?"

Unknown  1:14:00
I'ma be there

Cynthia  1:14:30
We know that we've seen people go into these shelters and yet, you know, get their section eight or get whatever. Why would - is there an ego thing that keeps us from wanting to go into these services because there's a stigma attached? "Oh, Cynthia is in a shelter, she must've not been able to do no better for herself."

Multiple participants  1:14:46
Yeah, yeah.

Cynthia  1:14:46
What is that? Why do we fight the places that can help us? I'm just wondering, just thoughts on that ego thing. You don't want people to look down on you and think that you are needy. I mean -

Unknown  1:15:03
I am needy. And then listen, they can look and say that.

Cynthia  1:15:05
Because Boston has such a plethora of services out there that we don't even know about it, and a lot of times you don't find out about it unless someone that you know, you know. So these services are here to help.

Tony Pham  1:15:17
I want to also, because you're about to say something too, right?

Genie  1:15:20
I want to speak on this because I work at a shelter. Yes, and the reason that they're doing the nine month is because families were coming into the shelters, and they were being sheltered for two and three or four years. But the ones that have to leave in nine months, they are giving them money. They are compensating them. They're paying them, they're paying their rent for them for at least two years, so they operate on the home base part. Okay, yes.

Blanca  1:15:20
So I'm just gonna add, okay, so with the immigration families that are coming in, I'm glad that they did what they needed to do. But with that being said, Boston, Massachusetts in general, we are - the society, how we are living right now, it's just overwhelming. They're building all these buildings, but it's one, it's not affordable. That's one - they are building not for us, yhey're building it, unfortunately, for the white folks. Then it's just too compact. The shelter system right now is over compacted. They just opened one in Walpole, where it used to be the Walpole jail. Yeah, families used to come into this building, that still looks like a jail, as a sign of Walpole jail, but they gotta live, right. Okay, fine, it's all good. I understand certain folks do come into the country to better themselves and whatnot, but not everyone is that mentality, they don't have that. They just want to come here because they feel it's a big opportunity, but they don't want to deal with all the extra stuff. The reason I say that is because I do work for the shelter system. I've been there, I lived in the shelter before. The difference from back then to now, now, it's all about for sure for the money. They've given out moneys for the immigrations to come in. They are giving them everything. Yeah, right, and they coming from foreign countries. But why are the families that are here, sleeping in the streets? Me and my husband, I lost my section eight due to full discrimination, but we live off our car every day. I wake up every day just to work with families that are in shelter, I'm not complaining. I'm still moving forward, and I'm going to get to where I need to get at but they giving out moneys for all this - for them to get housed, but we can't even get a dime. Because they felt that I did something wrong, which I never did. But they do want the families to come in, because it's all about like, contracting and whatnot. And the only reason I know this because the state end up saying all this to us, all the people that working with the Congress and shelter system and whatnot. So they are receiving money if family comes in from China or from Haiti, that's how - they don't put that out there, yeah, but they want overcrowded Boston, Massachusetts. Now, if they are here, this is the other scenario that is coming out. You only have nine months to find an apartment. How are you going to find nine months an apartment in Boston if a one bedroom is already, like, 2500 if you don't have no subsidies, if you don't have affordable housing, like there's no way. You either have to move out from Massachusetts in order to get the apartment. And that's what me and him are doing, because with my income and his income alone, we cannot survive in Boston anymore. So they are trying to make these families to actually fail again, and they're going to be back in the streets. So I'm fighting and I'm advocating, because I am writing to my legislator, and I'm like, "This is wrong, like we need to not give them nine months. We need to at least give close to a year, yeah, to hopefully sustain the family to move forward, get an education, if they need their working permit, work on that, and then you can move forward to find the apartment". But it's hard when you let them in - where are they going? You got a nine months period, because that's what's going to happen. They coming in, but they got nine months to move out. (Multiple participants talking amongst each other) Awesome.

Genie  1:19:29
And they are doing that, and I am just kind of understanding why they're doing it, because we've had families in shelters for too long.

Blanca  1:19:35
Oh, yeah.

Genie  1:19:36
you know, like, for four years, yeah. And that's just too long, and what it's doing, it's enabling them. They don't want to move on. So with this nine month cap that they're putting on it, they are helping the families. They're just not throwing them out with nowhere to go. They are still taking care of them.

Tony Pham  1:19:54
So y'all, I just want to mention I know that we are saying 2:30 y'all are free to stay and keep talking. I don't know. No worries. Well, if you got to go, no worries. If you want to stay and talk, I still got some talking points I'm happy to bring up, but I appreciate y'allm I do. Were you about to say something? Oh, yeah, I actually wanted to go back to something actually you were talking about, and it's about caring for other people in your lives, like your partners, maybe your cousin, your uncles. I bring this up because, like, I almost got the sense that it impacts you when you are putting all your energy into caring for someone, maybe it's your husband who's not getting care. And I'm just curious what that dynamic is like, like, how that impacts you emotionally, mentally, physically, when you are, you know, like taking care of yourself, but you're taking care of the other person too. Especially when it's partially because, you know, they're afraid to get care, they're afraid to see their doctor, they're afraid to go to these programs and stuff like that. Okay, so that anyone has thoughts on this, this particular issue.

Genie  1:21:06
I have a cousin right now. He has dementia. He's 73, it's really hard for me, because he's like my brother. So with him being in - he signed himself, he's a veteran, so he signed himself into the Brockton VA hospital. I guess he's signing himself in to get help, but actually he signed himself into a psych ward, so he's not able to come out. You can only visit him, you know, by schedule, he's not able to go anywhere at all, so it's really hard for us. Because when he wasn't in the shelter, he was wandering all over the place because he, plus, you know, he's a drug addict, so he would end up with the wrong people. I mean, we're glad he's in a place that he can't get out, but in a way, we're not glad because he just can't come out anywhere and do any kind of family gatherings. And it's just hard to see him like that, because it affects me mentally to see him like that, and to know that it's almost like I can't help it's really hard to just know that there's nothing I could do for him, and it's hard for me to have to go along with him when he's talking about stuff that doesn't make any sense. I have to, like, kind of go along with that, because if I don't, it escalates him. Yeah, so I have to say, okay, yeah, you're right. And it's just hard to see him like that, because he's just been so vibrant. And you know, it's just difficult.

Cynthia  1:22:48
Thank you for sharing that. It kind of resonates with me. For me, what I want to share with you is when you go through those feelings, just try to continue to save the serenity prayer, because a lot of things we can't change, you know. But God will continue to give us that courage that we need and what we need to get through things that we have no control over, but to be okay with your feelings, because they're actually - it's okay to feel that way because, but I'm glad you're talking about and expressing it, because it's more room out than there is in. But for me, I practice that serenity prayer because I have been used to, you know, having no control over stuff, but in this day and age of society that we live in, we never know what's been thrown our way, and ithese are cutting people in this family, you know what I mean. So just try to practice that serenity prayer, and I only offer that because it works for me, helps me to be okay with things that I have no control over, and things are going to keep coming at us because we're human and we're living amongst other humans. But thank you for sharing that. But I want to end because I have a group that I co host in the next couple of hours, and I just want to thank you, Dr Pham, for including me in this, really been cathartic for me, and thank you all for sharing.

Genie  1:24:08
And thank you Cynthia, thank you for all of the emails and everything that you send.

Tony Pham  1:24:15
I appreciate them too. Thank you,

Cynthia  1:24:17
Thank you, Genie. So you do receive it.

Tony Pham  1:24:19
I receive them too. Thank you. Good luck at three.

Unknown  1:24:27
Oh yeah, we gotta get on that day.

Tony Pham  1:24:31
Did y'all have anything?

Sandra  1:24:33
I just want to know if you're going to touch on anything, being before I slipped through the door.

Tony Pham  1:24:39
You know, pain is definitely a component here. And you know, if you want to share, like stuff that we should know or others should know about,

Sandra  1:24:47
I wanted to know what you were going to talk about, yeah, in terms of

Tony Pham  1:24:53
that's a good question.

Sandra  1:24:54
Yes, I do have my pains, but I manage them by exercising.

1:24:59
Something tells me you already know all the stuff I'm about to say.

Unknown  1:24:59
Me too

Sandra  1:25:02
Yeah, that's why I wanted to know something new I was going to learn, or even

1:25:07
Yeah, so you know, part of this focus group is actually about making a program like an exercise program, a meditation program, a talk program for folks with chronic pain. So, you know, bringing folks here is not so much for me to teach. It's it's more about for us, for everyone, to teach me and our team about how we can make this program appropriate, feasible, acceptable in ways that maybe other programs have not been because they don't take into account culture, community, you know, environmental stress and so forth. And that's also kind of why I was bringing in, you know, these topics about gender and race. Because, you know, maybe I don't think this might be the case, but like, maybe we need, like, an all guys group when we do this program.

Multiple participants  1:25:53
(Participants agreeing)

Sandra  1:25:59
Women and men

Tony Pham  1:26:00
Yeah, I see.

Leah  1:26:04
Then men might open up more with one another, because, you know,

Maria  1:26:12
manhood

Multiple participants  1:26:16
(Talking amongst each other)

Maria  1:26:21
Amongst each other, encourage each other to go to the dark, because you're going to have a few in there that do go, and you're going to have a lot of men that don't go,

Tiawanna  1:26:28
Have a group on their own, they can relate to each other exactly

Genie  1:26:35
Because that's what they always do.

Tony Pham  1:26:37
You know, it's funny, I've been to a yoga class before, and I sat in the back one time. And you know, part of this program is also about the some of these like exercises, like chair yoga, and I sat in the back, and two girls asked me to sit in the front because they didn't want me in the back

Unknown  1:26:53
looking haha

1:27:02
I was just like, "hey, it's a free thing at my med school. I'm gonna go to this free yoga class". And then I just realized, like, oh, you know, like, there is a gender component here. So it's good that y'all mentioned this, because I think that not only from the emotional talk piece, but maybe even the physical space too, that might be worth taking into account when we make these programs so that people feel more comfortable if they're doing some exercises or stretching and things like.

Genie  1:27:27
And I think with these groups, Dr, Tony's, we should - like you should because you're the expert on pain and stuff that - we should talk more about what we can do to help at our pain, because, like our pain causes depression, I can speak for that. It causes all types of mental pain. Yes, you know, because I already suffer from post traumatic. So when I'm in pain, I am not totally myself. So I think if you have more groups where we can find ways to help us alleviate some of our pain -

Tony Pham  1:28:06
yeah

Genie  1:28:07
- you know, I think would be good

Joanne  1:28:09
yeah, the natural way, yeah.

Sandra  1:28:12
But I find, though, some of the things when you say to people about doing or even trying to help the pain, nobody wants to do anything in general. So if you can give them a pill, they might take a pill. And some people don't like pills,

Soraya  1:28:31
because there's so many other ways to help with pain.

Sandra  1:28:36
Occupying my time, trying to do new things, it's amazing sometimes. So if you get into doing something how you can forget your pain, that's what I  you don't feel it the same way. I had a knee replacement twice on one leg and then one on another, because it was going so well, and I probably forgot a move, a block or something, and after what it started, click, click I had to put on a long rod. So I have two new replacement. I still do it like that, I do all kinds of stuff.

Tiawanna  1:29:16
Good for you. I understand what you're saying, because I had a knee replacement, right? And see I do water aerobics. Oh, my God, it's so wonderful.

Sandra  1:29:17
It's amazing.

Tony Pham  1:29:38
I want to circle back to that side. Were you, I just want to circle back, because I remember you were going to say something, and I felt, I felt like maybe it came back to you?
Multiple participants  06:01
(Participants talking amongst each other in small groups - unable to decipher dialogue)  Yeah they gave me oxycodone, and I was like "I'm not taking that!" So now I can be a drug addict, right? Yeah so I didn't take it either.

Tony Pham  07:50
Yeah, that makes sense.

Multiple participants  08:11
(Participants talking amongst each other in small groups - unable to decipher dialogue)

Tony Pham  08:15
We're putting this program together. We're like, choosing some exercises. You know, there's some, like, on the chair, there might be some where we're walking, and there might be some where we're sitting on the ground. I'm curious, like, from y'all perspective, if, like, we were to put this program together, like any particular exercises that you know leaps out at you is like, "Oh, those were the ones I really enjoyed."

Unknown  08:35
Tai chi

Tony Pham  08:39
Oh, okay I like this.

Timmy  08:42
And yoga

Unknown  08:48

Tony Pham  08:52
Good to know, yeah, yeah.

Phyllis  08:54
I do all that every, every day.

Tony Pham  09:00
Good

Phyllis  09:01
Monday - Friday.

Tony Pham  09:02
 I think that's yeah.

Leah  09:03
Oh, you do yoga every day?

Anita  09:06
Different every day, yeah, all the work different part of the body. Yes.

Leah  09:18
Oh okay, y'all ever try water aerobics?

Multiple participants  09:21
I do.

Leah  09:24
You go to the Y?

Sandra  09:27
I got to the Y, I go to the Crop.

Tiawanna  09:30
I do mine at the Mason school, yeah,

Leah  09:33
Oh okay

Unknown  09:36
well, I need to learn how to swim first.

Multiple participants  09:41
(Participants talking about water aerobics and the cold water)

Tony Pham  10:18
If you want, leave your contact information with me, because I want to get back to you with like, compensation and stuff like that if that's okay. Yeah, I just need your information, like a phone number...

Tony Pham  09:26
So just giving y'all some introduction. We're Mass General, this study is basically one where we're trying to make a community based intervention for two issues, one is chronic pain, and then the other is memory related problems. And our focus is not only in terms of chronic brain and memory related problems, but also what that means for the black senior community. So essentially, we're bringing y'all here to give us your input both in terms of, you know, what does it mean to have memory related issues, like, what are your main concerns about that either in the present or in the future? You can speak from your perspective, you can just speak from someone else's perspective, really trying to get a sense of, you know, what is the black senior community think of these issues. And then around the halfway mark, we're going to switch gears, and we're going to talk about the intervention itself, and get people to talk to like, what do you think about this skill? What do you think about this skill? And if you feel like it's dumb, you know, we're very open minded, because at this stage, we're more about getting the author's opinions to help shape that intervention. Oh, looks like your husband just joined us. Hi

Participant #4  10:41
How you doing.

Tony Pham  10:43
I feel free to take a chair anywhere you'd like

Participant #4  10:48
Well, I've been suffering from back pains just so everybody knows.

Tony Pham  10:52
so I was just briefing everyone. We're going to talk about memory related problems. If we had this concern that our memory hasn't been working the same way as it used to be. Our thinking, our concentration, so forth, but not quite meeting criteria for say, like dementia, just like I've been concerned, my memory has been changing. We will talk a little bit about chronic pain, but honestly, we'll be focusing more on the memory stuff. And then we're going to bring up an intervention that we're trying to get people's opinions on. So just like feel free to say whatever comes to mind when we start to go off topic or just reorient y'all, but I think really is just getting yall's opinion. So, you know, all this said, maybe we can take a moment to introduce ourselves. So name, where you were raised and where you live now.

Participant #4  11:48
I'll get started. My name is "Participant #4". I was raised in Dorcester, which is where we're at, just like right up the street and what I suffered for? Back pain.

Tony Pham  12:00
Okay. Gotcha.

Participant #3  12:03
Hi, everyone. I'm "Participant #3". I was born and raised in Roxbury. And yeah, I do suffer with migraines, and arthritis pain.

Mary  12:14
My name is Mary. I was born in Burundi, which is a small country in East Africa. But I moved around a lot. So I also grew up in Uganda and Kenya and Tanzania. And I don't suffer from chronic pain. I work with Dr. Tony Pham, and I called, some of y'all and have screened you over the phone.

Nomin  12:39
My name is Nomin. I'm also a screener. I was born in Mongolia, but I grew up also everywhere because I traveled around a lot. Yeah, other than that, I do suffer from migraines. But I'm not going to be participating in the chronic pains question.

Participant #3  12:58
Why not?

Nomin  13:00
 I guess I don't know. I'm not the subjects selection.

Tony Pham  13:04
Maybe a future one, right?

Unknown  13:06
I'm not just a president. I'm also a client.

Tony Pham  13:11
That's true. We are learning also through this process about ourselves. So it is an enlightening journey

Participant #2  13:23
My name is "Participant #2", I'm from Washington DC but I was raised in Roxbury, and I suffer from back pains, arthritis pains too. I had two knee replacements but it still aches in the back.

Participant #1  13:35
My name is "Participant #1". I was raised in Roxbury, I live in JP now, I've been all over in the community in Mass. I suffer from fibromyalgia. I suffer from bad knee aches, arthritis and back aches. So I think... I don't know what it is. And I suffer from a lot of memory loss.

Participant #5  14:03
My name is "Participant #5" I was raised in, I was born in Tennessee, but I was raised in Mattapan. And I initially came to the study for the memory loss.

Tony Pham  14:21
Got it. Thank you for that. And "Participant #6", can you can you introduce yourself as well?

Participant #6  14:29
My name is "Participant #6". And I was born and raised in Dorchester. I've lived a lot of places and right now today I'm actually suffering with a lot of body pain. I am really hurting my arms, my legs... No memory loss, just sometimes when I go to the kitchen, I said why did I go there? Tell yourself why you're going into another room, like "I'm going to get water in the kitchen" I say out loud, "I'm going to the kitchen to get water."

Tony Pham  15:06
Well, thank you for bridging into that. And maybe we can use that as the starting point for this conversation. If people are okay with it, I'd love to hear, you know,

Participant #5  15:16
Excuse me, I wasn't done.

Tony Pham  15:18
Oh, you weren't done. I'm so sorry. I interrupted you go ahead.

Participant #5  15:23
I think now I have pain because I was in the hospital for a week, and I got some bad medication. So now I'm waking up with like, body spasm and it's very painful.

Tony Pham  15:44
Sorry to hear that. But I'm glad that you are hopefully in good company. Because I think a lot of people here can perhaps understand parts of your story. Because it seems like it's been quite distressing, if I understand correctly. Yeah. So, you know, I know that in many ways, this focus group has been kind of described as like a chronic pain focus group. But one thing that we're also interested in exploring is the things that can make chronic pain worse, and how chronic pain can make other things worse, as well. And so interestingly, there's, there's research that suggests that when we have difficulties with our memory with our thinking, especially as we grow older, that can worsen pain, in some respects, especially when we're distressed about those issues. And vice versa. worsening pain can cause the stress and worsen our memory related functioning, our ability to focus, complete tasks and so forth. So, you know, I know that, again, this is going to be a very all encompassing focus group. But could people open us up with some stories they have, or memories they have when they've struggled with remembering things? And maybe their concerns in the moment? Yeah,

Participant #6  17:18
I took, oh God see I just forgot it. I took a mindfulness class, through Boston Medical. And it was a year long study. And what we did was, they were helping us to get back in touch with our senses, our feelings, and helping us to remember and also to helping to redirect pain in our body. So I learned a lot in that class. And if you ever hear of that study, please go because it's really really worth it. It teaches you how to get back in touch with the taste your thought process and encounter like not meditating, but taking and refocusing your pain, putting it somewhere else, you know, or, or not, it's kind of hard to describe, because at the time I was having hip and knee pain, but I don't have it that much anymore. And I don't like taking no narcotics. So I'm really into hollistic. So I've tried to practice anything that I can do to better myself, where I don't have to take conventional medicine. Yeah, it's for everybody. But the mindfulness class was really, really great. It was one of the best things I ever did.

Participant #1  18:55
What did you offer in that? Sorry to cut you off.

Participant #6  19:01
That's okay.

Participant #1  19:02
Are they still offering that mindful meditation class or that class that you did.

Participant #6  19:07
So it was a mindfulness class, through Boston Medical, you have a few doctors, you had - it was about 15 of us, and it lasted for a year. And you know, once a week we met on Zoom. And the doctors that were head of the program would show you different things, like let me give you an example. He had to... the first session he held a raison in our hand and then we put it in our mouth, so everybody went to talking about how the raisin...  how soft it was and dada dada da. You know, and filling it around in your mouth knowing the sweetness and how moist it was because you were holding an in your head. I didn't. I said, my hand is sticky. And then they wanted me to put this raisin in my mouth after the raison had got all through my hands. So I just thought it was different than the doctor said. That's what we were supposed to recognize, that instead of just putting in your mouth, and and swishing it around and let you know how it tastes and what was going on. And the thing was, holding it in your hands for about 20 minutes. And then yeah.

Tony Pham  20:29
And just to kind of go off on this topic, I think it's great because it brings into the conversation, something I'd also like to talk with y'all, which is this idea that we're also trying to make a mindfulness type of intervention. Oh yep, Miss -

Participant #1  20:46
I go to Tai Chi.

Participant #1  20:48
And we will do the Tai Chi with the person at Tufts Medical. And we would do these moves. And we would just be meditating, along with it to try to, you know, trying to help with the pain, yeah, to help us to not think about the pain. We're moving and doing the motions. Also, the thinking along with it, to stay in focus on what you're doing. And it's too bad that those programs don't last.

Tony Pham  20:48
Okay.

Tony Pham  21:24
That's a really great point. You know, I think the reason we're also coming together is figuring out how to make these programs last. And there are a number of issues that I could bring up. But maybe, you know, while we're on the topic of these types of interventions that includes say, like mindfulness, or meditation, or yoga or tai chi, what are things that have worked for y'all in the past? And what are things that haven't worked? And so you miss "Participant #6", you could even chime in about, you know, certain things about it that you felt really worked for you and maybe other things that didn't work for you.

Participant #6  22:01
Well, I, I enjoyed the class. It was a, I think everything that we did, it just brought me back in touch with our senses. And we've lost touch with that, you know, we don't pay attention to what we touch, what we taste, how we do things, because we're in a faster pace today than we did years ago, but I enjoyed it. And it did help with my hip pain and my knee pain, you know, just occasionally like when the weather's is getting bad, I can feel the barometric pressure for your arthritis and things of that nature. I can feel it. You know, I think it works with everybody, I remember a doctor long time ago, he was trying to create a instrument that would help us to stop like when the weather's going grey. So everybody's going to know, you got arthritis, you know when it's going to rain.

Mary  23:10
What about everyone else? Like what have your experiences been like with MBCT? Or, I guess what would be your recommendations because other people say that they don't last? And so what would I guess what would you like to see within the program if you could like make it your own?

Participant #3  23:30
For my own opinion, within the program, because since I do suffer with arthritis, I do agree with "Participant #6", you kind of know, when it's about to rain, you kind of know when the weather is crappy, like the pain just really starts and it doesn't go away. I noticed that the difference when I lived in Boston, I lived in Florida for some quite some time. The weather itself was beautiful out there. So of course, I didn't even suffer from arthritis while I was there for almost two years. Even if it rained, I still didn't suffer. But what I noticed when I was doing our study with BMC, the doctor that I had at the time, he was always giving me injection, I think it was like steroids. And mind you I have like already seven to eight surgeries on my kneecap because the pain is just so so severe, and I don't have no cartilage. So with the steroids with the medicine is still not helping. So I wish I could see... because I noticed that if I'm in like the water setting, I can't pay for the YMCA all the time or whatever, but if I'm in the water area, and just try to relax my muscles, somehow it does help me out. So I'm just trying to figure out how could I overlap the pain because I'd be in pain like half of the year. And I can't function too much. I can't sit for too long. But also you'll see me that I'll stand up for a second because I need to stand up because the pain is always severe. So just trying to figure out how could I reduce that pain because I definitely don't like the injection. I already had 10 surgeries. So I was like, I'm not having a no more surgery, the last thing that I got was that they didn't want to do the knee replacement. And I heard, man, you know, like, I'm skeptical, because if I do it, this is gonna really help me. Or if I could prolong it, let's figure out what other helps would help me with the joint pain because joint pain is like crazy. And I don't want to be on and stuff. So I do see myself that when I meditate, it kind of relaxes my body, because I suffer from migraines in a healthy way, because I'm relaxed. So I wanted to figure out what are the severe pain even though they say their diagnosis is arthritis, migraines, because it just runs in my family. Could it be at the same time that it could be stress related? Could it be something within the atmosphere, that is just, you know, projecting all this? I actually did a workshop or training workshop with BMC it's called MACO. They were talking about long COVID. They said that people that have experienced COVID don't know that they got long COVID and the symptoms that they have after they have COVID you have severe more migraines, you have severe, more joint pains, you have so many extra stuff after COVID, you know, after the fact. So I'm like, maybe we need to enter trying to figure out is it a part of long COVID? Or is it part of just the atmosphere itself, because I lived in a in a building, I'm sorry, I'm going over. I lived in a housing development, infested with rats, infested with mice. The quality of the unit, it was not, to me it wasn't to a human or like it, like you cannot really physically live there. But of course, I needed a roof at the time, a roof of my head. So I had to stay there for six years. So everything started like after the fact as well. Like I monitored the timeframe. And I was like wait a minute, why am I getting worse? So it's a lot of Intel. But we got to figure out what's the body? Is it the atmosphere? Is it the geographic? Because if you go to certain part of the city, certain buildings are up to code, no issue, central air, everything is fine. And I'm like, why is that? Why when you go to the black BIPOC community, everything is like dwelled in and it's just like... it's just too much. And we are the ones suffering, the minority. We are the ones suffering, you don't see too many people that are Caucasian, or different type of race, that are not suffering with that. I have a friend that is she's Caucasian, she's around my age, healthy, healthy! And I'm in the same boat. But I have all this crisis. And I'm like, why?

Mary  27:53
Thank you so much.

Tony Pham  27:55
Can we talk more about that? I think that you raised a really important issue there, which is how different communities have different stressors. Sometimes it's related to home environments, quality of air and food security. And I'd like to just get your perspective, especially when we're thinking about, say like the black community, what are what are factors that say intervention should keep in mind towards you yalls well beings especially when it comes to chronic pain, memory related issues as we're creating this intervention?

Mary  28:25
Even your experiences with racism as well. Knowing that, like, for example, when you go into a building, and you're like, I'm the only black person here and then like the anxiety just kind of hits you all at once. So how has that been like for you as well, because I experience it like I work at MGH, which is like, statistically white. So how has that been like for you going into those white spaces and then coming back home and realizing like, Wow, it's so so different.

Participant #3  28:52
I mean, of course, the anxiety is always there. I work for a it's funny because I work for Heading Home, which is a family shelter assisting families that are trying to get their permanent housing and whatnot. Mind you, I'm homeless myself right now. So that's why me and my husband are separate right now because he lives somewhere, sometimes we sleep in the streets, it depends where we stay at a given night until we get our apartment again, but heading home is the majority is Caucasian, I want to say probably about 30% is BIPOC community. But I noticed that - I thought it was not a toxic place - but I noticed that in my agency, they do go for their own type of people unfortunately. Let's put it this way. So right now, families that are moving out and my position, I'm a coordinator to assist the families to for raffle, homebase whatever the case is the funds that they need in order for them to move out and be self sufficient. Right now the state decided that any coordinator that place a family out, we supposed to get an incentive. I look at when my director was at the time, she was like this will help you out to pay off your debt, which is my rares and get out of homelessness and get into your permanent housing. Everything was working fine until she had to give up. Because, mind you she was Caucasian itself. But she was trying to help the people that work there, the people of color. And my bigger boss decided like, No, we're going to distribute the money amongst everybody I'm like, But why is that? If the state clearly said it was only for the coordinators and case manager, which has accepted it, but right now I'm still fighting it. And I said, if you decide to fire me, at the end of the day, I will sue Heading Home, because they basically take my money that the state actually is bold in print saying is only for coordinators and case manager but they wanted to distribute amongst I don't know how many employees we have. But they wanted to. I'm like, wait a minute, but there's some people that get at least 100,000 in a year, fixed 60,000 a year? Why would they need to benefit out of that if we're the one who works with the family so closely until the end, we shouldn't be overturned. My director that I had at the time end up leaving just because she was all about us. And she wanted to make sure that we it was me with someone else that is dealing with some other issues. And the money would have made us be okay, mind you, we do everything that we have to do. But they still treat us like we don't exist, but yet they want us to do so much work. But they don't want to pay us the way they should. So right now I am trying to get into the state where she went because she wants me to follow her. But I'm not leaving until I get my money. Because if you give me my money, I know if for the other people that do need it, we will get off. The racism is still real. You always have to advocate for yourself. It doesn't matter if that's why I like diversity. Because the more diversity we are in the community, within the job within the wherever you live at, I will see a different type of atmosphere of less violence, less, you know, domestic violence and things like that is just having a home because everyone will come together instead of being apart. You know, like I saw when Trump went in, everyone got divided, like, oh, just because you're Muslim. Oh, you know, you don't know that. Every one... a Latino could be a terrorist, like you don't know, you just just because of the way of the color of your skin, you gotta justify someone, no, I'm sorry, you need to know the inside of the person in order to move forward. You know, and that's why coming like this together, we kind of have to try to get the answers and try to promote change and stuff. Because the health unfortunately, Caucasian folks gets the better health, better care. And then when you go into community of BIPOC you don't get that services. It is a shame, it's a shame.

33:01
See you helping all these people. They should be helping you as well and dealing with that same situation. But unfortunately, it's not fair. It's not, you're doing it you're helping others and you're in that, somewhat of that a predicament yourself and they're not helping you.

Tony Pham  33:23
Is it ever the case where you know, I recognize y'all are bringing up very reality based issues, you know, things that are issues that affect you on a day by day basis. Now, I'm curious you know, do you ever feel like there are times when this stress this unfairness kind of gets under your skin and affects say like your pain or even like your ability to think clearly and have clear memories and so forth.

Participant #3  33:52
It does

Tony Pham  33:52
Could you get into it?

Participant #2  34:01
Well, you can't change the world, it's always gonna be the world and you just gotta live in it and do what you have to do to make the best of it.

Tony Pham  34:10
Yeah, yeah. How about you, "Participant #5"?

Participant #5  34:14
I think sometimes anxiety and heavy burdens sometimes weigh on your memory process because at that point, you're like in flight mode so you can't really understand... you're not there in that headspace to put things in priority. So you do things as you.. for me it's almost like I do things like the impulsivity starts to jump in because I can't think to put things in order my concept of organizing. Just because I'm too busy just trying to think of what I can do because I'm overwhelmed.

Participant #5  34:31
And to those, could you give us a window into what that feeling of overwhelm means? Is it sort of because you're stressed about what these changes mean? Or are they? Yeah,

Participant #5  35:16
because, I mean, for example, I had a death in my family. And I was the only one that was able to deal with everything. But I had other things as well. Also, I have small children. I also have my own health. And I also have like housing things going on. So

Tony Pham  35:41
it's all of it together.

Participant #5  35:42
Yeah. So, it's no way like one person if they don't have any help or anyone to help or any great coping skills for them to deal with. Like I said, yeah, flight or fight mode.

Tony Pham  35:59
I think you bring up another good point, too, which is that, you know, life is so busy, it can be very stressful, and sometimes it can be hard to get the care you need. I'm wondering, from your perspective, in yalls community, what are barriers that have come up when it comes to getting care for say, like, again, like memory related changes, chronic pain, and there's also stuff that's related to the health and well being of our brain. So it's like physical activity, you know, being engaged in mental activity, physical exercise, healthy diet, reducing our intake of say, alcohol and other tobacco products. You know, when you think about all these things that we have to do to maintain our brain health, our chronic pain levels, our memory changes, like, what are barriers you see with getting care for those things?

Participant #5  36:48
Sometimes it's not just alcohol, I mean, it will help you through things, but it's also diet, certain foods we shouldn't eat. Because it also can take precedent over our world.

Tony Pham  37:14
gotcha. Yeah.

Participant #1  37:18
I just think it's a lot of things in between. Me, I'm a grandmother raising grandchildren again. And there's a lot even though it's good in a way, because it keeps me focused, and it keeps me motivated. But also, just like "Participant #5" said, the food, do you see they bring the worst foods here. And instead of them, you know, they don't... even if they got good foods here is an arm and eight legs. So we can't even afford it. Because it's too much money. And we don't even get that much money to even be able to, you know, buy the things we want to buy. I'm glad they have farmers market in different places, but not everybody's qualified for it. You got to you know, the way to get our health in order, we need more places where we can get more healthier foods. But when we go in stores, and sometimes they say organic, we don't even know if they're organic! Who knows how long those foods have been sitting before they got to the shelf, and then they put an expiration date on it, which probably has already been expired. Yeah. So we don't know what we're eating. We know they say that's what it is. But we don't know what the deadline is for it. There's a lot of stuff like I know my grandfather used to get the gout when he was eating certain things. And yeah, and all that seasoning and stuff, get hypotension. And some people even have heart attacks. But it's just a lot going on out here. And it's not geared for us.

Tony Pham  39:10
And what about, sorry go Nomin.

Nomin  39:11
What about health care? How do you see -

Participant #1  39:15
Healthcare? People sit in the hospital now, you got to be there for eight hours. Eight hours and you could be released - one day I went to the hospital, I had pneumonia didn't even know. They told me they took one of those, they didn't put the one under my tongue, they put it over my head. And I said, Oh, she can go sit in a waiting room. I said, No, you're gonna do it the other way. You're gonna put it under my tongue and you're gonna check because I've been sick for so long and y'all keep sending me off. My temperature was 104 and they took me to the back. I was so delirious. I didn't even know if I was going to come in. I didn't know what was wrong with me until they started taking the test. So therefore, if you don't fight for your rights, they will push you away.

Mary  40:01
Yeah, and how has that been like, feeling like every single thing that, when it comes to diet or going to the hospital, like having to constantly advocate for yourself, how has that experience been like for you? I can assume it's been very, very frustrating when you're going there, like, this is their job to take care of you, but you're actually telling them to do their job.

Participant #3  40:22
This is, to me, it's exhausting. It's just, you know, I shouldn't be. I'm not a doctor, I'm not an expertise, but I know my body. And so I feel some type of way. And I'm letting you know, you know, can we check on this or what not? Just, you know, go by it. Because if anything, the doctor should listen to the patient and whatnot moving forward. My husband, um, there were certain things that he was encountering. And the doctor kept saying, Oh, I think it's like, they have a timeframe for everything. For colonoscopy that's when you're 50. You know, mind you I'm 50. He's 51. But I had mine's before. Why? Because for the simple fact, it does runs in my family. But, at the same time, I was feeling some type of way. My doctor kept saying, No, you're not 50. I was, I think, like, late 45, something like that. When you're 50. I said, No, I don't want to wait till I'm 50. How about by the time I'm 50 something else is going on. So I have to continually, I'm always advocating for myself. So the doctor eventually did it. I told him the same thing. But his case is a little different, because he doesn't like doctors, unfortunately. But

Participant #4  41:41
I'm sorry about that.

Participant #3  41:42
But, now he's about to go and get that done. Because he's 50 going on 51. But the doctors will prolong things, just because of your age. Like, it doesn't matter. I could be 25. And so I should I should have the ability to tell my doctor, hey, you know, runs in my family, I feel some type of way, is there a way we could check just to be on the safe side? Normally, you want to check if people have breast cancer, you want to check if you know, pancreatic cancer, then why can't we just check, you know, we have a feeling? Let's just check on it, it doesn't hurt.

Tony Pham  42:17
And when you're thinking about that disconnect, you know, between yourself and a provider? Why do you think that's the case? You know, I know there could be a variety of reasons.

Participant #3  42:26
I'm sorry, I think it's because they look at us that we don't have the funds, and we don't have the good quality health insurance. That's the first thing I think of because I used to work as a medical assistant. So I see what doctors going what kind of insurance they have. Like, that's the first thing that comes in your mind.

Participant #6  42:43
It's also your age because I'd like to share something with you guys. A couple of weeks ago, well, back in October, I went to the hospital to the emergency room at Boston Medical. And I was having a lot of pain in my chest was like naturally when you haven't done it right away. And I'm over 70. So they took me in the doctor's and told me all my results, get the X ray and all that stuff. And told me they did an echo too. Told me everything was fine. I have an appointment with the cardiologist at Boston Medical about two weeks ago before I left of going out of town. And he talks to me telling me what's going on my, heart's in great shape. Just before I stand up put my coat on, getting ready to walk out the door, and he starts to tell me - by the way, you have a little calcium around one of the valves in your heart. Because I said to myself, why did you wait after 20 minutes of talking to you and tell me this when I'm going up door? Is it because I'm black, because I got good insurance. Is it because I'm older and you really don't care? And then he gave me an appointment a whole year away! I asked him what can I do about it? Oh open heart surgery or stent. Now who tells you that?

Participant #2  44:19
No one should tell you that

Participant #6  44:23
So what I did was I looked at stuff myself. I'm doing regiments to try to remove the plaque and not eating things that build the plaque. So and I didn't really eat I don't eat beef and I don't eat a lot of fried foods so I didn't understand it. And I couldn't understand why the emergency room doctor said one thing and this doctor said something else. I'm inclined to believe it's two things, you're old and they don't care. Excuse me doctor, and because you are a person of color. And they think that you don't take care of yourself. But I don't take any medication at my age, nothing.

Tony Pham  45:09
I love that. Thank you so much. One thing that you raised that I thought was interesting was just your focus on the holistic side of health. And I know every community is different, you know, my parents are Vietnamese, and we do different things for pain. We're doing different things when we're concerned about our memory. But you know, thinking about things like, concerns about memory loss or concerns about pain, are there things in the community that we should be aware of and promote? You know, as when we're thinking about these types of interventions for pain a memory?

Participant #2  45:39
Yeah, acupuncture.

Tony Pham  45:40
Oh, yeah.

Participant #4  45:42
I don't think that one. I tried it once

Participant #1  45:46
It worked for me.

Participant #3  45:51
I think it depends on the person enduring.

Participant #6  45:54
- a little bit in you. And then before you know it that long needle is down in your body, and it really will fix things.  Now the workers in charge referred to doctor when I was working with black Washington COVID coalition, and how she started out her scared and, and everything was just all messed up, because she's walking around and doing all kinds of different things. Because she went to a holistic doctor that does the acupunture the only thing about that, they won't take our insurance. Everybody doesn't have a lot of money.

Tony Pham  46:32
So I think that's a really great point. And maybe we can use this to transition to thinking about some of the components of this intervention that we're looking to bring within the community. And so I'm not sure if we got a chance to bring it up. But the specific intervention that we're talking about, and don't worry about memorizing the name, but it's called mindfulness based cognitive therapy. It's a combination of few skills, mindfulness, meditation, some basic yoga exercises, as well as elements of talk therapy within a group of say, like eight or nine people. And you know, if it's okay with y'all, I'd like to kind of walk through some components of this intervention. And I'd like y'all to be as fresh as you can just about like, what do you think about some of these elements, and especially as it relates to say, your community, and the black senior community and so forth. So let's talk about say, like mindfulness, meditation and yoga, are there certain things about that, that you think would go well, for the community or

Participant #4  47:37
Before that, before you get to that. Yeah, I had a question.

Tony Pham  47:41
Yeah, please.

Participant #4  47:43
Me, my pain is crazy because since I suffer from anxiety, bipolar, and all this, other things, I seek mental health. And it's funny how when I feel so down and depressed, I also feel my back pain coming with it. I don't know if anybody feels the same way about that. But that's where I feel in my body.

Mary  48:10
I was also curious to know, how have you experienced has been like, as a man with chronic pain as compared to like your wife, like, do you feel like, since she's a woman, she's able to be more expressive and more vocal, maybe people are more able to listen to her versus you or maybe just because of socialization, saying that you have certain types of pain, saying that you have some mental health issues, like people are gonna look at you differently.

Participant #4  48:39
That's why I'm quiet a quiet person. But um, what was I gonna say?

Mary  48:45
Anyone can answer based on the men in your life. Um, do you feel like there's differences between men and women who have chronic pain and even like, mental health issues and how they're received and how they express them?

Participant #1  49:01
I think so.

Mary  49:02
In what way?

Participant #1  49:04
Men sometimes they don't want to go to the hospital. They don't want to admit to certain things, even though you can see it. No offense. They want to be a man, they want to be you know, they don't want to be the person that yeah, they want to be the man. They don't want to be looked at them as Oh no, they're a wimp. They're not wimps they're just, you know, that's just a male mentality, or whatever that word is.

Tony Pham  49:34
Would you say that that's like the culture?

Participant #3  49:36
I believe so. Yeah, I think it's a culture thing because my son is the same as his dad. So kinda like the woman has to be behind because his wife is the same way. I usually, have you made an appointment for your physical? No, not yet, could you make it for me? So it's like I'm constantly behind him to kind of check in when I'm not supposed to. Sometimes I kind of like draw myself off and like no, you have a mouth, you call? Do you need to be proactive on your health because, again, he goes into the room by himself, I can't be in there at every given time. So he has to, and I think society for men and younger kids as male, I think they need to have that as a broader sense of making sure they're promoting that. It's okay to say, you know, I feel some type of way, or, you know, I saw something in my leg I don't know what that's related to. You know, it's okay to just be able to open your mind, open your mouth and speak about it so we could find out what's going on. Because at the end of the day, if you wait till you're kind of like 50, or 60, might be too late. So that's why it's better to do it as young version versus when you're like, 50 or 60. Because then what.

Tony Pham  50:50
Exactly.

Nomin  50:52
Can't fight yourself.

Participant #1  50:55
They never go to the doctor and we'll say, look, you need to go get that checked out. Oh, I'll get there. No, go there now.

Participant #4  51:03
I have an appointment to check my kidney.

Mary  51:12
How do you think as women you contribute to that, like, I come from like, I'm African. And so there's this whole sense of like, men are supposed to be strong, and not show weakness, but I also feel like the women, in a way contribute to that when like boys is still younger, like, don't cry, don't show your emotion. But then when the baby girl does it, and that's fine. So how do you think you play a part into that? And how could you, in a way moving forward, change that so men can feel safe?

Participant #3  51:40
So within my sense, I have four grandkids, three boys and one little princess. So my son is the one that gave me the three boys. So I am always on top of it I said, Remember how he was when he was younger? I said, don't do the same mistake, boys. So he's actually on top of it, like, oh, no, they got a physical today. Oh, no. But then when he tells me certain things, so the the cycle is changing, but it all comes from the parents. So I always explain to my son like you always have to check because you never know is better to detect anything from early ages than versus you know, later on. One of my grandson, he's diagnosed as - he's very hyper. So he cannot sit still, for certain extent. But he's very hyper, then I have one that hasn't been diagnosed, but they are possible thinking could be autistic, or he has a learning disability, because he's already three but not speaking as clear as he could at this moment. So he's always behind it. And then I go back to are you checking yourself now. So now that he's a family man, taking care of his boys, now he does what he needs to do, you know, do his stuff. My daughter was a different way. She was already going to appointment, she was always being advocated for herself. Baby girl came along, she made sure Oh, six months appointment, you know, whatever, because she's about to be too. So now she's being proactive, but the father is a little bit hesitated. And I noticed that you have to continue speaking about it. Because my granddaughter was sick, they came back from a vacation. And I noticed that she was sick, she was coughing and whatnot. First thing that came out of my mouth, I said she must be sick. And she definitely has to have something, either an infection or something. The father to refused to go to the hospital. Why? Because we're going to be there for like three to four hours and then they're going to say she has a common cold and nothing about it. And that's it doesn't work that way. You have to continue advocating, even though it's frustrating, but continue to advocate for your child so that way they could do X ray, figure out what you really had come to find she did had a minor cold, but she encountered an infection within her lungs. So it's basically holding the mucus, because my daughter told me this yesterday, and I gave her some - because she was waiting for some results - but I gave her some medicine, because I'm always on top of things. So I ended up giving her that and she was like mommy at the end of the day, that's what it was. Because she's been coughing for like two weeks that cough should have been gone. But by me given her that I'm like, okay, that's gonna help her to spit it out. She's still a baby, she gets bedded out. But it took that long for the doctors also to kind of say what she really has. So it's always just being proactive and stuff. But if you continue the cycle of change, making the change, your kids will have been officially benefiting and kind of overdo it, but some families don't be behind it.

Tony Pham  54:35
Nomin were you about to say something?

Nomin  54:36
So you were talking about like being an advocate for your children for your husband.

Participant #3  54:41
And sometimes it's exhausting

Nomin  54:42
Yeah! Do you think that like has any effect on you finding care for yourself or like having some sort of self care when you're caring for so many other people like that?

Participant #3  54:52
So some people's are different for myself. I'm always I love doing what I do for my kids or for anyone within my family. But when I see myself kind of like, Okay, I'm getting tired, my stress level was getting up there and my pain is getting worse. And I said, Okay, it's time for me to get some me time. And I eventually do it so I will miss a probably a day from work, I'll probably take a long weekend and just be away from everyone, like, my kids won't know where I'm at. And just try to just be away and just take some time for myself and stuff, and then go back to reality. It's when I come back, you know, so it does take a toll, but you always got - your body does let you know, when you're drained. You know, my job was getting at that point, I just took two or three days off, I told my my boss, and I'm like, I need to take some time. You know, because it's all about work. Of course, I'm trying to get back on my feet. But if I continue doing that, and then something happens to me, then okay, they could just replace me the job continuing, but then I'm not here. I gotta be here for my kids and my husband. So

Tony Pham  55:55
I'm gonna switch gears a bit. I really do like this conversation. But it's part of the unfun part of making sure we touch on everything. But, you know, one thing that I just wanted to hear more about was, you know, this issue of changes in our memory, you know, changes in our ability to think especially as we grow older and get concerned about how our brain is developing. Could folks share some, you know, personal stories, or maybe just other experiences, say in the black community where people have had concerns about changes in their memory,

Participant #4  56:28
the way my mental illness is, this sometimes where my mind blocks, and I don't I doze off and daze off as well. And like, you guys are talking to me right now. And I can't grasp everything you're telling me, you know what I'm saying? If you was to tell me can you explain something about what I just said? I will tell you right now, to be honest. Can you repeat yourself? Because I lost track of what you was telling me. Yeah. And that that goes with my mental health. Because that's the way, that's why I seek help with with my mind. Yeah. And, yeah, I would have to tell you, can you repeat that again so I can grasp it better?

Tony Pham  57:20
No, it makes sense. And I'm curious, you know, when you say, you know, it may be due to my mental health, do you think you're referring to say, like, how our brain ages? Or is some other issues related to like anxiety?

Participant #4  57:31
Well, I feel like, my brain is aging. But I'm talking to you like years back, my mental illness started when I was making my teens.

Tony Pham  57:42
I gotcha

Participant #4  57:42
You know, and I never seek help. I never seek help, until I was already an adult, like already in my maybe 30s, or something like that, you know. And my pain also started when I was in my 30s, like my late 30s. And here I am at 51. And doctors have never done anything for my back pain. Well, one time, they told me that since this your lower back, we can't see, I don't know if it's true, we can't see what's bothering you. Because it's my lower back. I don't know if you have something to say about true or not? I don't know.

Tony Pham  58:20
It's hard to say, you know, maybe I'd be happy to follow up with a conversation one on one, we could kind of flesh out some of those things. But it can be confusing, like you said, especially when our time with the provider is so limited. It can be hard putting together. Okay, what does that actually mean for me? What does this diagnosis mean, for me and so forth? And it sounds like there's still some blanks there that you'd like to be filled in on? Yeah.

Participant #3  58:46
Could they be like more? Okay, because I know they have a lot of research within dementia, Alzheimer's and whatnot. I have an aunt who has dementia. I've had a grandmother that had Alzheimer's and whatnot. But I'm noticing within now, because I remember how my memory like I was very good. I can remember everything the numbers, phone numbers and everything like that. Now I'm always jotting down. Like when it comes to relate to work, or even when my grandkids birthdays, like I forget. And I'm like, I'm like, how was that the only numbers that I kind of remember is my date of birth, my phone number, and my social security when it comes to anyone else is like, within my family, my immediate family, like I kind of forgot. And then when it comes to work, I have to jot everything down. Like if this client is about to move out what she needs next. I got to say, Okay, next tomorrow step, this is what I got to do. If I do a study if I do a class, I do have to, I can't memorize it. I can still jot it down, take my little notes, but I have to have a good quarter. Because right now I'm kind of the same way like him. So I'm grasping everything I will grab certain parts, but if I have my recorder, I will go back and say, Okay, this is what he said. And then I'm going to continue, you know, working on that. But sometimes something that they could help us guide us if our memory, is it as you age, is it getting worse, or does it start at a certain point? Because I did a research not too long ago, and they only they will do like a memory test, but they just put like three apples or the banana or they put numbers or whatever, that was less than two minutes. To me, that's not helpful. Like you need to do a really in depth within your brain for they could kind of figure out okay, to you, are you going to suffer in the long run dementia or Alzheimer's? Or where does it go?

Tony Pham  1:00:47
So it just needs more clarification.

Participant #3  1:00:49
Yeah. Like, yes.

Tony Pham  1:00:49
In terms of like how is this diagnosis being made? And can it really be made with this super short test like that.

Participant #3  1:00:55
I didn't get that research, but they did anything.

Tony Pham  1:00:59
"Participant #6", were you about to say something?

Participant #6  1:01:01
Yes, I just wanted to say I would agree with the young lady that was just speaking. And I am a little bit older, but I think a lot of it is just technology. And the things that are not good and in order for us, our bodies can become you know what's the arthritis. And like I said, the arthritis and all of those things are acidic we have a lot of acid in our body. And it's built up from the different things that we eat and drink. And that affects a lot of stuff. Like I remember I can remember all my grandparents phone numbers but I don't even know my son's phone number I don't know. But I used to remember all numbers by heart but I think our telephones our computers have made us very lazy. And some of the things we have to change. When we don't ask people when you get older you just say okay, I want to change but a lot of times to better ourselves, we do have to change we have to practice something different to like I feel risky to people in Boston and the things that I buy a sort of prices on but they're shocked me they have to acclimate my body back again. Because all you guys sitting in that room know that we used to walk past each other and shock each other? When is the last time you actually touch somebody and shocked them? What is it electricity and all that. The thing we're eating and nutrition and this Tony was saying earlier, Dr. Tony was saying earlier about a lot of different cultures like the Asians they eat a lot of different food that is healthier for you. And we may not like it because we're used to certain things but the things we buy at the stores are just not for us.

Tony Pham  1:03:16
and I'd like to give him a moment to hit up both "Participant #2" and "Participant #5". Are there other things you wanted to chime in especially about like you know concerns about memory and so forth?

Participant #5  1:03:28
Well, I don't know what she said about the food. Even the food here if you buy produce in this neighborhood. It doesn't have as much shelf life as if you go out to like.. I mean you can - I mean you could sit and try to test yourself. Yeah, no, you can buy strawberries from Wegmans in inviting strawberries, a day later the strawberries in this grocery store is no good. They were already starting to you know more, but strawberries in the produce dried out. It has long shelf life.

Participant #4  1:04:10
Yeah, I noticed that as well. Because when we go to the outskirts of Boston, we see better things than there is in Boston... I will call it the hood, Roxbury, Mattapan. You don't see those good things that you see in the outskirts like in the suburbs of Boston.

Mary  1:04:33
So you would say that food completely changes when you go from Dorcester to like Cambridge?

Participant #4  1:04:39
Yes! Yeah. Yah,

Participant #2  1:04:51
When you buy a watermelon that will have no seeds in them, good watermelon have seeds in them and that you can get no more than that. See it's not that good. Well, nice be really good.

Tony Pham  1:05:21
I could see how you know, as we're making this intervention, if we just kind of tell people to eat healthier, that's not enough. We need to think about the disparities and how food is available in different neighborhoods, and how it may be even invalidating to say to someone like you should eat healthier if you want to get your blood pressure better, and all these other things related to pain and memory and brain health.

Participant #4  1:05:43
Mind if I ask where are you guys shop?

Tony Pham  1:05:46
I usually stop at Stop and Shop. It's kind of closer to where I live. But I live in Somerville, so kind of a nicer place.

Participant #6  1:05:58
I shop at a farmers market.

Tony Pham  1:06:01
And they take EBT too

Participant #6  1:06:05
Right down Copley then they have a lot of people that come and then sometimes they have the farmers market that comes to sales corner. People that have grown their own vegetables and things and and they sell them and they don't cost as much. And you were talking about Struthers you guys. Be careful with the strawberries you got to clean them with. Baking soda and vinegar.

Nomin  1:06:45
How far do you travel to go to these farmers markets?

Tony Pham  1:06:55
Can you hear us okay?

Participant #6  1:06:59
Now, if I'm downtown Boston I go over there, at some infield corner area, I go there. And sometimes you don't have to go that far to scan because I would say in the shelf life in Dorchester Roxbury, and Mattapan, those who will - I mean, like they have the daily table, right? The daily table is less expensive than Stop and Shop. But how long does it last? Put in your refridgerator and then if you buy the frozen stuff it has so much sodium in it, we have to start renewing our labels. I'd like to share something with you guys. I have a cousin that needed a kidney she had a kidney disease for almost 20 years. But what she did was, she stopped buying foods that have so much sodium in it. She took potatoes, which has a lot of starch in it and she cut up the potatoes to make potato salad, french fries and home fries. But she will let them sit then probe the starch out of them in the water, cold water, put it in the refrigerator, let them rest for hours. And they still taste good. But you didn't get all the stuff that they were putting in the ground when they grew these things that were very harmful to our bodies. I stopped eating meat. I do a lot of fish. I still do chicken. But I'm trying to stay away from that. Because if you look at a real chicken, you ain't never seen the chicken we never

Tony Pham  1:08:42
Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna shift gears again, if that's okay with everyone

Participant #6  1:09:02
God on my street, the people in the neighborhood and they get the tomatoes and I mean this lady took so many tomatoes needs to get the whole neighborhood debated, then you don't even want to buy or tomato at the same time and and we have to do better in this if we start spending money on stuff. I know we have to whether we just pay a little bit more attention to the things that we have to eat and let them know that we are not settling for this, you know, I'm not going to miss a day, you know, three hours a head of cabbage. And if I put in situated for two days, I'm going to offer

Tony Pham  1:09:48
Listen I'm going to cut you off for a second, I appreciate this. I think this is good fodder for discussion but just because I want to be mindful at the time. I want to ask a few other questions if that's okay, too. You know, this is going to be again about this intervention that we're trying to make this mindfulness based cognitive therapy. So I'm just gonna throw out some parts of this. And maybe y'all could just chime in with, you know, that'll work or a that'll not work. But we're especially thinking about save the black community, because we want to make sure that, you know, our interventions are cultural and they make sense and they have meaning. So, you know, when I bring up something, say, like, talk therapy for, like, these kinds of like, diet changes, or, you know, when it comes to getting more exercise, for our brain health and for pain, would talk therapy and this kind of way work in a group setting?

Participant #3  1:10:43
I think so.

Tony Pham  1:10:44
Okay.

Tony Pham  1:10:48
Like talking amongst people, groups as like a kind of  therapy

Participant #6  1:10:52
I think so. They say knowledge is power.

Participant #5  1:10:53
yeah, and maybe we could do some chair yoga or something.

Tony Pham  1:10:59
Okay. Yeah, that's a great question, too, because a part of it will also be doing exercises together, especially walking, but also some physical exercises. And I know it can be tricky when you're in pain, too. So are there specific exercises that you know, would be a no go for a lot of folks

Participant #3  1:11:16
Even to learn what can we do because I could walk, if, even though I'd be in pain, when I walk for some reason, I don't feel the pain until after I'm done with my walk. But when I bend my knees, that's when I'm severe. Like, I can't do squats. I try, but I can't even just doing it two times, I'm already like feeling it. So other ways that I could exercise my legs, because I could walk, like I could walk for 30 minutes 45 I'm fine. But then at the end of the day, I will feel the pain. Yeah, like, I'll hold on, like, it doesn't help me. But I need to find other ways that I could actually do some exercise within my legs, because I don't want to feel like I can't do anything. You just want to find other ways that will be helpful, but kind of doing the same thing.

Tony Pham  1:12:06
Well, that's good that it seems like there's openness to that. Sorry are you saying something?

Participant #6  1:12:12
Water!

Tony Pham  1:12:12
Oh, yeah. Water aquatic? Yes, I love it. What about things like, you know, I mentioned them briefly before, but say like, mindfulness meditation, are those things that would be accepted in the black community?

Participant #5  1:12:33
Well we could call it prayer.

Tony Pham  1:12:33
Prayer. I love that. Could you talk more about you know how you feel prayer is also kind of meditation.

Nomin  1:12:43
And religion

Participant #2  1:12:47
Prayer, prayer, prayer!

Participant #6  1:12:49
Well, personally I've taken a mindfulness class. And they did, like I said, it was a study and they paid us for it. But I learned a lot from it. Because it thinks and of like mind over matter.

Participant #3  1:13:04
Yeah!

Participant #6  1:13:06
I didn't want to take drugs because I'm allergic to codeine. And so I can't take all that so I had to find another way. And I just believe that there's other ways we can, you know, focus. And I think if you could get a mindfulness session going, Dr. Tony, yeah, it would be great. I would love to be a part of it. Because I enjoyed the mindfulness class.  I don't have - I had a lot of things yesterday, because I did a lot of stuff. You can't overdo it. But yes, I've been from one to 10 my pain has been two and three.

Participant #6  1:13:45
That's really good.

Participant #6  1:13:55
I haven't had a lot

Tony Pham  1:13:58
Mary, are you saying something?

Mary  1:13:59
Yeah. And typically, like, I know that, sometimes it's not feasible to have like a mindfulness class that goes all year, right. But let's say if it was like, between six to eight weeks, and then you learn are these skills? Do you think that's something you'll be able to continue doing after the sessions are over? And if we were to tailor it for the community? Like what are the things that you feel like would help people retain those skills and be consistent with them? Because that's typically an issue that we see where the classes and and then you no longer have that like accountability, or you know, have that community. So how can we help you continue to practice those skills?

Participant #3  1:14:40
to me I'm always about learning and growing at the same time, but even if we are part of this mission, at the same time, we're being trained for it because then we as individuals can bring it to the community as well. To continue the cycle again, it's always gonna go fall back into it if you guys can't continue because it is time setting, but the next individual like let's say, Me, "Participant #1", anyone from here, right? Participation, have that type of training, at least the basic, then bring it to the community and continue the cycle like that.

Tony Pham  1:15:14
 So that brings, sorry, that brings us to another question, too. But, you know, one thing that we've been thinking about to make this more sustainable is changing who are the people who can deliver this type of intervention? Now, classically, when you know, when we're talking about these mindfulness based classes, I will say, unfortunately, they do seem to be in certain neighborhoods, generally very higher socio economic neighborhoods. And they generally are composed of white individuals. And I'm just curious what that may mean for other people, especially BIPOC, people of color, what it means to go into a space that may be in generally say, like, white neighborhoods are generally composed of white people and white instructors.

Participant #3  1:15:59
I mean, spread our awareness as much as I can. Yeah. But as long as you have that diversity, if you have to be in the white community, bring it out there, you have to be in the, you know, just bring it out to the community itself, period for everyone to learn and understand what's going on in moving forward.

Mary  1:16:16
But the question is, do you think people would feel more comfortable and more willing to participate? If they saw, say, a BIPOC person instead of a white person?

Participant #3  1:16:26
Actually, yeah, a BIPOC person

Mary  1:16:28
like, so how would that I guess? What are the how would that make you feel? For example, when you go to a doctor, you see a black doctor, like, how does that make you feel? What kind of feelings come when, when that happens for you?

Participant #3  1:16:39
If I see a black person, I'm talking about health and whatnot.

Mary  1:16:43
Yeah, like, for the instructions for the programs? Right? How would that make you feel? Well, that makes you feel more safe with that

Participant #3  1:16:49
more secure

Mary  1:16:50
make you feel more secure, as you said, would that make you want to continue to learn these skills, be more present in classes..

Participant #3  1:16:56
but it's, I don't know my opinion. It's not about the color too much. It's about how you project what is your mission? What do you want to get out of it for the community to get that type of awareness? If I feel that the person is like, Mr. Tony, I feel he's genuine. I feel that he's doing this because he wants to figure out what's going on. He wants to figure out how to do another alternative, and why not within the community? If I feel it, and I think everyone could agree, if you feel that vibe, that connection is gonna go well, but if you because I'm the type of person that if I meet you the first time and if I have a feeling, I don't have that connection with you too much. I will stay my distance, but I'll still listen. It's just having that feel secure and the safety that is gonna go well.

Tony Pham  1:17:46
speaking of that feeling. Yeah, go on.

Participant #6  1:17:49
I'm sorry. Two

Tony Pham  1:17:55
Your time is about to go, can you hear me? She'll rejoin. I gotta, I gotta upgrade.

Mary  1:18:05
Does anyone else want to say anything with regards to that topic, like anything that came to mind while she was speaking, and

Tony Pham  1:18:12
sorry, I will also throw in

Mary  1:18:15
talking about during the instructions of the program, seeing someone who who looks like you're someone who's honest about your mission and like what they bring to the table, that would make you feel more secure.

Participant #1  1:18:26
Like, I have a program where we're dealing with this people of the communities that work with the people in the community, because they're not going to come to you and look at you make you somewhat and feel comfortable talking to yeah, there's a lot of people also that's undocumented. So you're going to have to find a way to deal with them and connect with them as well. Yeah. And they're not going to come out and say things. They need advocates. They need advocates to work with them

Participant #6  1:19:05
I'm back. I can't hear you. I can't hear you

Tony Pham  1:19:21
can you hear us now?

Tony Pham  1:19:33
Can you can you hear us now? How about now?

Participant #6  1:19:39
Yeah, okay. I wantedd to share it with the lady black,  the black women in our community, they're doing a lung cancer study and all you do is just an x ray. For people that, women that have smoked, and we want to make sure that you don't have any lesions or anything in your lungs. And then this is one thing I'm sharing with you guys. You guys can share it with somebody else. And Dr. Tony knows who Dr. Chen is at Mass General. And they were the ones that were doing it and he passed the information on. And I've been telling a lot of black women about it, and they're paying you for this. Yeah, it takes two seconds to do the X-ray. But take you about 20 minutes to do the walk.

Tony Pham  1:20:35
I think that's, that's kind of the direction a lot of hospitals are going into, you know, expanding how we get health care, even if it means getting into studies. And just to pivot one more time. But you know, we were talking also about this idea of making the instructors of these classes more diverse, more representative of who we are. And one thing that we're looking into is bringing instructors from the community. So they don't necessarily have to have like a formal training like an MD like me, PhD, even LCSW. But people who still are willing to learn, and offer these classes at an affordable rate. But you know, one thing that does come to mind is, you know, if you were to get this kind of training from like, another peer in your community, who's also someone who identifies as black lives in your neighborhood, has chronic pain has had issues with memory. Would you feel comfortable getting an intervention like that?

Participant #3  1:21:32
You know, yeah, definitely. I always love to just share the awareness. I always like to, I like resources out there. Because when I was younger, there was not enough resources. There's there was not enough communication organization trying to join together and try to teach the community and what not. So this is actually good that if more people get involved, more people share their awareness, more people just going to be collaborating at the end of the day. And because a lot of people want to know, why the food this way, why our health is this way, like they want to know now, before we didn't care. Yeah, now it's like all about yeah, we definitely have to care about our health, we got to care about our children, we got to get care of our seniors. Now, it's like always a question why, why why? How we get that by us being communicated and being collaborative amongst each other.

Tony Pham  1:22:22
And when you think of places that we would want this intervention to be, are there specific spaces you want, would you think having it both zoom and in person all in person, like what are your thoughts on all that?

Participant #6  1:22:36
Because a lot of times, I may not be there, I would like to be a part of it. But that's on me, you know. I enjoyed meeting everybody here today.

Participant #1  1:22:47
And I enjoy seeing you here.

Participant #2  1:22:49
Stay safe!

Tony Pham  1:22:51
we appreciate your presence, even all the way from Michigan. You know, when we think about also spaces, like I can think of say like, you know, us delivering this kind of mindfulness based cognitive therapy, like at the Y maybe at UCB

Participant #2  1:23:08
Yes!

Tony Pham  1:23:08
or at senior centers you know, I'm curious what are what are places that work?

Participant #1  1:23:12
At the school

Tony Pham  1:23:12
At the school?

Participant #1  1:23:13
Yes.

Tony Pham  1:23:14
We have a school right down the street. I think there's a senior center I forget what it's called. Yep, exactly. And so -

Participant #4  1:23:21
Community centers?

Tony Pham  1:23:22
Community centers, that can be one, okay. And you know, even

Participant #2  1:23:26
You could even go into you know, just bring up something. There is senior places all around.

Participant #1  1:23:44
And also, I'm in a connection program where you all can come in and talk someone can come in and talk to you the way and they have caregivers raising grandkids, family members. They want a lot of workshops to come in, that will be good.

Tony Pham  1:24:04
I love that. So you know, thinking also about what amenities can we offer to people coming into class because they got other stuff on their plate, taking care of kids and so forth? Are there other things that we can provide to make the intervention better

Participant #1  1:24:15
Childcare for some of them and meals.

Tony Pham  1:24:20
you're thinking about also like doing mindfulness meditation, yoga, I know sometimes other people have other things they like to do like a story sharing or knitting and so forth. Are there certain activities that we should think about?

Participant #1  1:24:35
Yes! Also, like Tai Chi.

Tony Pham  1:24:36
Tai Chi?

Participant #6  1:24:37
I love Tai Chi.

Participant #2  1:24:38
Or even a book club.

Tony Pham  1:24:41
I love that. Nomin, I interrupted you a few minutes ago, but were you about to chime in or something?

Nomin  1:24:47
I was gonna talk about the setting.

Participant #5  1:24:55
Sometimes we do it at the park. Yeah.

Tony Pham  1:24:57
At the park. warmer outside. Yeah.

Nomin  1:24:59
I do have something to say. So, with these places, we might be able to bring some like extra things like pillows, cushions as people with chronic pain. Yeah. What do you think would be useful?

Participant #2  1:25:13
Rolling matts

Participant #3  1:25:14
Yeah, the mats.

Tony Pham  1:25:15
Okay. yoga mats.

Participant #4  1:25:21
Pillows

Participant #1  1:25:21
Those big balls you can do this with.

Tony Pham  1:25:24
Okay, we love it. We love it.

Participant #5  1:25:26
Anythign people could sit on.

Participant #4  1:25:29
I'm good with pillows.

Tony Pham  1:25:32
Trying to make it comfortable as well, you know, we do want to make this about y'all. Like,

Participant #2  1:25:37
Those stress things

Mary  1:25:40
Resistant bands?

Participant #4  1:25:44
For so long, I had to get up a stretch my back, you know, because when I sti for so long, that's when I start feeling it more.

Participant #6  1:25:56
They have that they have that building in Chinatown on Oak Street. And there's a school right there. And every morning, it's about 15 Asian people out there doing something like that they have schools, a lot of schools love Dorchester Roxbury, and they might let us use their yard, you know what I mean? When School's out.

Tony Pham  1:26:18
And, you know, one thing I also was thinking about, you know, you brought up this wonderful idea of prayer as a part of how we how we reflect how we meditate, and I think every culture is going to have a different idea of what does it mean to to channel our attention and our focus so that we can make a positive impact on our lives. And I recognize also, especially say, in the black community, you know, having a Christian background is important relative to say, my background where Buddhism is more important, but how can we make the space more inclusive, you know, when people are coming in with different faith backgrounds, different ideas about what meditation could be? Are there elements that we can make the space more comfortable?

Participant #5  1:27:02
When you call it meditation it kind of encompasses all you need, when you call it meditation, but some people

Tony Pham  1:27:11
they see it differently?

Participant #5  1:27:12
Yes, different belief.

Participant #4  1:27:19
I think the way I met I meditate personally is by getting on my cell phone and playing solitaire, spade, or play a game

Tony Pham  1:27:33
that's how you're setting yourself.

Participant #4  1:27:34
That's how I meditate. where, like my mental health not so great. Yeah. So when I get these racing thoughts that I have in my head, sometimes I just get on my phone, and I just try to try to block everything that's going through my mind. You know what I'm saying?

Participant #6  1:27:55
They have one called colors when you play Oh

Participant #4  1:27:59
yeah, yeah. Yeah,

Participant #6  1:28:02
it's called color that's good for relaxation

Mary  1:28:05
have any other recommendations of activities that you can do that you're not staring at a screen where because eyestrain and all that so

Participant #4  1:28:14
I go to sleep

Mary  1:28:15
Other than sleep

Participant #4  1:28:17
No, I think that -

Participant #3  1:28:21
I feel like, I mean everyone could be different because he's totally different than me. When I meditate I actually like to hear music, but I listened to house music, like it's always beats Yeah, so I just intertwine to those beats and then I usually have like a meditation book. And it's always it's like daily question like how you feeling today? How is independent what is the question then the next one will say how could you overturn emotions like that? Or even call the calm?

Tony Pham  1:29:00
Let me turn this actually around because you brought up a really good important topic, which is music and sounds. What kind of music would you think work in this space where we're trying to promote, you know,

Participant #4  1:29:15
soft music? Like, like listening to soft?

Participant #3  1:29:20
Like natures or something

Tony Pham  1:29:21
nature sounds, instrumental music Yeah, birds, water sounds all right.

Participant #1  1:29:35
And I say Siri, play Animal music therapy. And it's even helping me Yeah. So

Nomin  1:29:45
They have the same with plants too, so the plants grow.

Mary  1:29:52
When you speak good words to the plants then they like to do and then if you dont then they die.

Tony Pham  1:29:57
You know another topic I'd like to bring appears, you know, it's always about making sure that people feel comfortable getting this type of therapy. And you know, one name for this is mindfulness based cognitive therapy, right. Kind of a mouthful. But when we're thinking about intervention, say that focuses on, you know this prayer, mindfulness meditation, this yoga exercise, the ball exercises, the talk therapy about lifestyle factors that can affect brain health. What do you think would make a good name that would be inviting? I'll give you an example. Right? Like, one participant? What's up?

Participant #6  1:30:39
Peace

Tony Pham  1:30:39
I love that . Something that we've gotten in the past is the idea of making it understandable. Sometimes, maybe not using say, jargon. I'm curious. You know, when you when you think about intervention names or therapy names, are there ones that you just think like, that sounds wrong? Or ones that you're like, oh, yeah, that sounds sounds like my kind of speed

Participant #3  1:31:02
Well how come it has to be a word. It can't be a symbol?

Tony Pham  1:31:06
Oh, like, all right. We also think about, you know, how we, how we draw it as well, because I think that could also be a part of it. Not having too many words.

Participant #4  1:31:19
the symbol question mark

Tony Pham  1:31:20
Question mark. These are all good. Yeah. What about just the title before you know that this intervention is based off of this idea of calling it mindfulness based cognitive therapy? Or with does that kind of capture it?

Participant #4  1:31:36
How about just the first letter of each word? Yeah.

Tony Pham  1:31:39
Oh, like MBCT or something like that? Yeah. Okay. So acronyms are also okay.

Participant #3  1:31:43
Yes.

Tony Pham  1:31:44
Okay. All right. Well, that's, that's reassuring to hear.

Participant #4  1:31:47
But that's a long word.

Tony Pham  1:31:48
It's a lot. It's a long word. mindfulness based cognitive therapy doesn't roll off the tongue. That's really great.

Participant #5  1:31:55
Well, even the A for art and

Tony Pham  1:31:59
art therapy or something like that. Yeah.

Participant #1  1:32:02
And add it in some part of that abbreviation that you put out there, okay.

Tony Pham  1:32:08
We can do that.

Participant #4  1:32:09
SM self meditate

Tony Pham  1:32:11
Self meditate. I like that. And, you know, another thing that I've noticed, like when I've taken this class in the past, they, they actually push against this idea that it's something that's about the group like group therapy. But do you think say in, like black communities or communities of color that it's important to, to think about the group? Or do you think it's, it's more mostly about people coming in and individually getting their care from, say, like, the instructor.

Participant #3  1:32:40
It's, it's for everyone individually. And as a group, you're being collected, because you're learning from each other, from each other we learn but you're also going there individually, because you're also working on yourself.

Tony Pham  1:32:54
And I will say, I know where I'm sorry -

Participant #1  1:32:57
all works together. Yeah. Because we can work like "Participant #3" was saying, we're going to help each other. But we're also working to help ourselves in the meantime.

Tony Pham  1:33:08
So I also get the sense that it's important to be able to share your experiences with issues and so everyone's stories and so things that you want to Yeah. Well, I know we're kind of running -

Participant #4  1:33:24
No rush, can we stay another hour?

Tony Pham  1:33:28
you know, I can stay for as long as you're happy to stay here.

Participant #3  1:33:31
Yeah.

Participant #1  1:33:37
I don't gotta pick no kids up right now.

Tony Pham  1:33:43
I appreciate that.

Participant #1  1:33:46
I think you should have a little longer than next time.

Tony Pham  1:33:48
I think that's right

Participant #3  1:34:01
When you go to like, you know, when you hear, okay, so now hour to an hour and a half. In reality, as you come, you're trying to learn from each other, you're trying to like kind of get the feeling. But in reality after 30 minutes past, 40 minutes, that's when the depth conversation really comes in. Because you feel more relaxed, you feel kind of engaging more, as opposed to when you first started, so I think a little bit comfortable.

Nomin  1:34:27
For these intervention sessions. How long do you think is like the perfect time?

Participant #1  1:34:33
Well, depends on how many people you have yes

Tony Pham  1:34:35
let's say around like eight or nine

Participant #1  1:34:37
eight or nine? Well, I think that I said two and a half to the eighth person. That probably would be the two hours that's what I did. You're just now trying to get to know each other

Participant #4  1:34:49
I say between two and two and a half.

Tony Pham  1:34:52
And so yeah, what about this? So let's imagine this is like the default this is the, the schedule that we would do If we didn't make any changes, once a week, eight weeks, an hour and a half.

Participant #3  1:35:07
I like it. It's continuous and you kind

Participant #4  1:35:12
You're the doctor, man!

Tony Pham  1:35:14
I think. I think it's also important to recognize, you know, everyone's lived experience. And I'm sure it's also kind of a balancing. Okay, this person might be too busy for an hour and a half, but also thinking about how people are opening up later. Yeah, and how sometimes even two hours is good. So to make sure as you make sense, yeah. But I'm glad y'all are given us this input, because it's really important to make this about y'all. And there's no way we could do it without hearing your input. Yeah. That sounds like time is flexible.

Participant #4  1:35:41
They say they say two brains works better than one.

Tony Pham  1:35:44
That's true. That's true.

Mary  1:35:47
What are your feelings about possibly like homework assignments from from the intervention? Because I know sometimes when you leave the intervention, and then you have more to do, and then life is happening that can be hard to do. So. Do you feel like having taken home is good? Or like, how can we structure it to where you're practicing these skills, but it's not a burden to you, when you go home?

Participant #3  1:36:08
I prefer to take take, because like I said, I focus more. If I have to do like an assignment, I'm better off doing it, like on my own intertwined to focus, you know, if it's in the middle of the night or whatever, I'm making sure that it's gonna be done. Because during the day, I'm pretty much busy.

Participant #1  1:36:31
So it depends on the homework that you're asking. Now, if it's more body work, and stuff like that, that's not writing.

Participant #2  1:36:42
Yeah.

Participant #1  1:36:45
I can do that.

Participant #4  1:36:46
I don't like reading

Participant #1  1:36:48
You have been relaxed too. Right. I'll be sitting writing and then I forget, and then I'm writing down, what was I doing? So when you start having like, more activities, then you can put the kids in it, and you can do some things that will -

Tony Pham  1:37:10
Oh, okay.

Participant #1  1:37:12
But I would really like to do Tai Chi again. Yeah.

Mary  1:37:14
So do you feel like videos and pictures will be better versus just word?

Participant #1  1:37:19
Who's just said without using technology?

Mary  1:37:22
Well.. a little bit

Participant #4  1:37:28
Good. That's the future.

Participant #1  1:37:31
It a lot of stuff on it that can help you. Yeah, I'm talking about the other stuff I go on it for church, I go on there to learn things I go on there, you can even go in and learn how to bake and make stuff. You can also go on the app to have some kind of peace. Yes.

Tony Pham  1:37:50
You know, another thing I want to bring up is, you know, this idea that  we're trying to empower people from the community to be these instructors. And unfortunately, when it comes to training to be an instructor, it can be a bit intensive, say, if I were to do the full training to become an instructor, and this mindfulness based cognitive therapy, aka mpct, sometimes can take up to two years it can cost 11 grand. And, you know, we recognize that these may be even barriers that prevent people from the community and being sort of like teachers or instructors in these types of interventions, but what should we be keeping in mind so that we can make this type of training as accessible as we can make it be?

Participant #3  1:38:34
I will say that to have flyers, but at the same time, have questionnaires for the community, what they think about certain, you know, a certain angle questions, multiple questions, and why not to see what are their reaction by you bring it out to them? And what is the feedback from that? Yeah, that's how I feel.

Tony Pham  1:38:53
It seems like there's some interest in becoming these instructors and getting this class.

Participant #6  1:39:07
I know that I have actually seen at a lot of different programs, and it's free to residents of Massachusetts.

Tony Pham  1:39:18
I did not know that and I think that's another thing we're thinking about incorporating as part of this you know, resources! Because I know there are a lot of resources that we at Mass General have but you know, when we do this groups, I have learned so much about what's going on in the community and all the resources available to because it's not simply sometimes one class but people may be interested in other kinds of ways of healing and getting better in terms of brain health, chronic pain, so forth.

Participant #6  1:39:45
I don't know who exactly you would talk to over at RCC, maybe I can find out because my sister is one of them professionals over there. And I do know that the classes, they have a lot of nursing programs and medical programs. They needed to talk to somebody to see if we can get them to input. Yeah.

Tony Pham  1:40:12
The more information, the merrier. As I say, "Participant #1" were you about to say something?

Participant #1  1:40:18
Yeah, I was just thinking about, UCB

Tony Pham  1:40:21
oh, yeah

Participant #1  1:40:22
we did a lot of training and different things. The people that we were, because I used to be also, we started off as diamond leaders, and then when to network leaders. It's like, it's just things that you have to do - just have retreats. To get people together and be interested so that they can help do what you're doing. That's like, every that's why he doesn't have to do a lot because he's got us all aboard. Yeah, we all started doing okay.

Participant #3  1:40:55
that's why we love to collaborate. Learn as much as we can.

Participant #1  1:40:59
Yes. What happened?

Tony Pham  1:41:02
Oh, no, it's just sometimes my screen goes black, but it's still on. What are you saying something "Participant #6"?

Participant #6  1:41:11
I just said I'm here.

Tony Pham  1:41:14
Other thoughts? Other comments that y'all had? You know, again, we've been talking about a number of things like changes in our memory concerns about our memory, chronic pain concerns about chronic pain, lifestyle factors that can make chronic pain and memory related changes better and prevent later illnesses. We've been talking about the MBCT intervention, how to make it more accessible for everyone. Anything else that y'all wanted to say that we didn't get a chance to touch upon?

Participant #3  1:41:42
When do we start?

Tony Pham  1:41:43
Well, I can outline, you know, in terms of the timeline for our study, you know, at this present moment, we're more about gathering information through focus groups. So that is going to lead us to writing the manual. And as some of y'all mentioned, you know, making it less wordy and less intensive, probably will help increase accessibility, so people want to do it. So that's going to be on our end, we're going to be working on it, we're going to be just reaching out to just get people to pilot this intervention. So we would do like a small pilot that might be like, next year, once we finish this manual, so it's going to be a slow process. But we want to make sure we do each step right. So you know, we're doing the focus groups, now. We're going to pilot it, and then do bigger pilots and so forth.

Participant #3  1:42:29
So this meeting, we have, maybe I misunderstood when I was reading the text. Yeah, this was the first meeting, we have an another meeting next week?

Tony Pham  1:42:39
I'm going to try to make that happen. I know that we we've been getting some increased funding, but I would like to do is kind of keep people involved during each step. So ideally, I can't promise it, you know, when we do make this manual, for instance, we might have another meeting where we reimburse people and get their thoughts like, Okay, here's page one, as we had talked about, you know, we're calling meditation something else. Now. We're opening up to prayer, and so forth. And then we'll get everyone's opinions again. And so I think that's got I'm hoping to kind of rope y'all back in to get more input, because it has been a very informative time today.

Participant #3  1:43:16
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

Participant #2  1:43:18
And then when you do start that. When you're going to do the eight week program, would any of us be a part of it?

Tony Pham  1:43:25
I think so I will say, I was already approached a for one of our pilots by another person. So we're going to work with her temporarily. But I think that this is going to expand, right, because we have to do more and more pilots. And I think that's when we can ask more and more people to volunteer. So you know, nothing personal, it's just sort of didn't happen chance in terms of, but we're definitely going to be you know, doing it once well, and then again, and I think that's when we can kind of bring in more people who are interested in being instructors with this idea that we can create a project that can develop legs of its own, so that, you know, we MassGeneral aren't funding it, but it can already be funded, say in the community, because it's sustainable. It doesn't cost that much money can be done in community spaces, just based on goodwill and desire to make your community better.

Participant #4  1:44:14
One person can bring the crowd.

Tony Pham  1:44:16
I think so that's what I've been seeing that

Participant #4  1:44:18
one person and one mic. They're all gonna come in.

Tony Pham  1:44:21
Yeah, but I could see it as also community thing where several people are.

Participant #1  1:44:28
I understand you're doing 50 and up. But what about a little bit younger? Yeah, they all having pain and lots of people having pain, 45 and younger.

Tony Pham  1:44:37
Exactly. And I think that we already have changed the age from 65 to 50. Because we're recognizing that these issues are starting earlier and earlier. I will say to you know, as far as our study goes, we do have to stay by the books for a bit. Yes, but I do know that.

Participant #3  1:44:54
sorry. I know. They have to see that the outcome. Yeah, if it looks well they definitely will probably intertwine younger ages and it's gonna happen

Tony Pham  1:45:04
because when we're doing this, they're also going to want to see whether it helps. And so to do that they'll kind of want us to stay by the books in terms of who we've developed this intervention for. But I do know that in other trials and other interventions when when something successful for a group of people, they do want to think about it for another group of ages, and their ethnic background, so I do think that work that we put in now could open up other doors to great but if you're interested in other studies do feel free to reach out you know on all sorts of different studies. You've heard about them. Yes,

Participant #3  1:45:38
the lung. I'm absolutely interesting. They could do the X ray and stuff because I was a smoker.

Tony Pham  1:45:45
if y'all want I can make a group chat with y'all.

Participant #3  1:45:48
 Oh, that'd be awesome.

Tony Pham  1:45:50
I could connect unless someone has any objection to their number being shared. Okay, I'll make a group chat for y'all and yeah, again, thank you so much.

Mary  1:46:02
Thank you. We do have this other focus group happening down the line so if you know people who meet this criteria please have them like give us a

Tony Pham  1:46:14
very similar same age chronic pain but also if you have issues with mood like feeling depressed feeling low this is a similar focus group with more about depression and gender yeah

Unknown  1:46:38
(Finishes up with people packing up food, exchanging numbers and thank yous)

I don't know why she says hers is expiring. points don't expire. What is that?
Teri: Where you take pictures of receipts, and you gain points and then you can trade your points in for gift cards.

00:18
Oh, for any receipts, any receipt. Any receipt? She knows all the good stuff she needed.
Tony:  Yeah, you guys want to use those receipts there?

00:32
Teri: I already took them, the receipts. No, no, but those are they the same.

00:37
Teri: Is that the same?
Tony: I think it's all for the food today.
Teri: Yeah, but is different ones.
Teri: Yeah, there are three different ones.
Teri: Yes. Perfect. You may have

00:46
taken that.
Teri: Yeah, because it'll say this receipt has already been Oh, whatever. That's why I asked him does he do it? So? You know, I'm not gonna take his points.

00:55
Tony: Oh, no, no, I'm just learning about it. But it won't be till a minute till I wrap my head around.

01:01
Teri: Yeah, no, any receipt?

01:03
Brenda: Can you pass me? Oh, yeah.

01:05
Tony: Here we go.

Brenda: Can you pass me a fork, please?
Tony: Yep, here you go.

01:13
Teri: And then certain, an onion rings to do this.

01:17
Tony: I think one of them came with onion rings, hopefully.
Teri: certain items they give you extra points for certain things. At certain stores.

01:19
Teri: certain items they give you like extra points for certain things and certain stores.
Tony: Amazing. I didn’t know about that.
Teri:  So you'll get like, extra point you or whatever? So like if I see a receipt on the ground, or whatever i pick it up.
Tony: I like it.

01:43
Tony: And I think some of the orders came with cold potato salad. So

01:47
Tony: those  are there too
Teri: I'm good. No, mine is a salad. So I probably didn't.
Tony: This coleslaw must have come with

01:52
Tony: come with someone. Yeah, that's fine.

01:56
Tony: Um, yeah, I got a receipt that I picked up for Total Wine. And I guess somebody had got some Jack Daniels or something they got on there. And that ended up being like, 700 and some point. So yeah, so different items they give you know, whatever. If you buy Frito Lay or if you buy something, something it's worth. Yeah.
Tony: So and

02:21
Tony: anyone wants these drinks?
Teri: No worries. Not? No, I got them out here.
Tony: So, actually, I'm happy to start now if folks are cool.
Tony: Yes. Yes, actually, I'm just going to ask if you can pass this around and kind of sign in. I can also write for you.
Brenda: Okay, you can? Oh, I go.
Tony: And then if y'all can just sign in. But yeah, you know, today, again, as always super informal. But, you know, coming here from Mass General, and were trying to flesh out this therapy, we're creating where we want to in the community, and then hopefully, with folks from the community to really make things more sustainable. But, you know, to do that, we really have to get your perspective on a few issues that may be of concern. And then I know that some of y'all have been to the previous focus groups, some of this might be repetitive, but you know, I think it's always nice to get you back out. And get your perspective on, you know, how we can best deliver this intervention in a way that's most accessible. But here you go. So that's the first thing that y'all are probably aware of, but a lot of this this focus group in particular is going to be about memory related problems. I know that sometimes it's hard to tell whether you know, you have a full on diagnosis, or this is just regular aging, right. But if it's okay with y'all, I'd love to get some perspectives or anecdotes when you know have, face issues with just remembering how to do stuff or doing things that you used to be able to do like doing taxes or just regular day stuff. And it will be especially enlightening first to hear you know, what that meant for you? Whether what if it was like a fearful experience or a worrying experience? So yeah, I'm happy to kind of just pass the baton to anyone here.
(): do we need to add our social security number too.
Tony:  You know, not Yeah, I don't want everyone to see that. But we'll get that at the end. Yeah. And then do the work. She coming back. Okay. I'll get her in a second.

04:38
Brenda: I can. I, I'm Brenda. And just the other day, I was trying to remember I was just trying to remember. The name of not a person's name, but the name of something And I really, really could not remember. And it frustrates me. I get really angry. Because I don't think there's some things I just feel like, I shouldn't forget. You know, I just shouldn't. Yeah. And when I do I get really angry.
Tony: Yeah.
Brenda: You know, when I, I tried to, sometimes I try to go back like to see, like, I'll go in the kitchen and say, Oh, what's it something in here? Or I'll look on my phone and say, was I gonna call somebody? But it's just really frustrating.

05:38
Tony: Yeah, and you know if you could talk more on that frustrating feeling, because I think that there's something to talk more about there in that when we do have issues with our memory, our thinking and so forth, being frustrated, feeling anxious, and these other issues that come up can make it worse. And then it can make it hard to tell like, okay, is this my aging issue? Or am I frustrated right now, and it's making everything worse? Did you feel that when you were frustrated, not that I'm trying to put words in your mouth? But was there any kind of relationship there where you notice even further changes when you were say, like, angry with yourself and so forth?

06:13
Brenda: No, just, it just seemed like, I don't know. It just seems like, I should not forget, like, one time that was I know, it was somebody that I know, and I know them. And it's like, I can picture them. Sometimes I can look at somebody's and I don't know the name, just can't get it out, you know, and then I have to go through, like, I'll go through the alphabet, A, B, C, D,
Teri: that’s what I do when I forget stuff.
Brenda: and then if I'd come up, then sometimes I'll get the, you know, bring it back, but not all the time. And I just, I just feel like I shouldn't be forgetting as much as I do.

06:58
Teri: You have no, I'm the same way I do the alphabet with stuff or just thinking of stuff. And I forget, okay. Whatever. But I always bring this up. And that's what really kind of made me it could be even like the chair, or whatever. And I'm telling somebody Yeah, and I went over there and sat and like you said you like and really like hell
Brenda: yeah. How are you gonna forget that it is a chair to put your butt in.
Teri: exactly
Brenda: That just doesn't make sense.
Teri: But it's your brain because the what really what got me going. So I always tell the story. And actually, I'm getting ready to go on the same trip next weekend, going to Atlantic City for an event thing of whatever and stuff and you know, you go up and get on the bus ride down, whatever, whatever. So later on, you know, I was thinking about the trip and whatever. And for the life of me, I couldn't remember how I got there. I remembered the trip and whatever. And then I remembered another time when I went down because a friend told me that you know, for my birthday, whatever, the comedy, I said no, that was with me. And I said how did we get down? I could not for the life of me remember how I got there. And then later on when I finally remembered, I'm like, really high, you forget going up there getting on the bus and go or, you know, so things like that. It's kind of like, wow, like, Oh, like this? Yeah. And even when my mother, God rest her soul when she was getting kind of older. She used to say she said, I gotta get used to the new me. You know, like certain things, you know, you, you know, you noticed a change in yourself with different things, but I write everything down. Everything down. And when I think of something, I don't be like, Okay, I'll get to it or whatever. It's like, no, stop right now. But you know, good and well, you ain't gonna remember, right now. Sometimes I have to stop. Like, I can be brushing my teeth and think of something. And it's like, no, not gonna wait till you finish brushing your teeth. You're not gonna remember and if,

09:04
Brenda: if somebody's in my house, and I think of something and I feel like I'm gonna forget, I'll say so and so remind me of this. Right? Sometimes it doesn't because

09:17
Teri: they have forgotten too.

09:19
Brenda: Oh, that's exactly right. Yes.

09:23
Teri: That's why it's best to just do it right, then we think of it or write I write everything that usually put

09:29
Brenda: I usually put everything in my phone, you know, because then it's right in my face. But still, I don't want to I don't want to have to depend on my phone when I want to, you know, remember something? I think it's, it's, and I think, oh my god, I'm gonna be sick. My brain is not, you know? I don't know. It's just crazy.
Tony: And I

09:52
Tony: just want to also offer an opportunity if anyone hasn't spoken yet. You know, if you have thoughts and the same issue memory related problems, don't feel shy.
Dorothy: Okay.
Tony: Thank

09:59
Tony: you.
Dorothy: let me tell you my story.

10:02
Tony: Can you say your name because we're gonna be listening.

10:05
Dorothy: I had, I had two surgeries. I had surgery like four months ago, I had one a month ago. I don't know how I got into surgery room. I don't know how my daughter has told me everything I did. I don't remember anything else. I remember the pain. And that's just like four months apart from I'm like, my daughter was like, Mom, you don't remember. We don't remember we didn't know that's something right, this fall off the pot, you forget your whole surgery.

10:35
Tony: So that's scary.
Dorothy: Yeah.
Tony: And what kinds of things have helped in the past when it comes to you know, memory? You know, there's just like, I think

10:51
Tony: Screen shots. that's a good one.
Teri: I just writing things on postage, because that's what I do. Even when I have to do some errands. I'll write down first in my daily planner for that day. And then when I'm going out, I put stuff on a posted and I bring it with me and I put it in the car. And when I do stuff, I cross it off. Alright, you still got to go to this and this and this to
Tony: Mr. Kincaid. We’ve got another party member

11:13
Mike: hi, y'all. You know, Tony calls you Mr. King, but everybody else calls me Mike. If you call me Mr. Kincade I might have to go look for my dad.

11:30
Tony: No, no, no. It's corned beef sandwiches

11:32
and drinks over there. Yeah. All right.
Tony: Yeah, we're just talking about memory related problems, like talking about people's experiences and what that felt for them, you know, that see a change in terms of their memory and their thinking. So if anyone else wants to chime in with their story, I know sometimes it's kind of hard to talk about. But another angle to is what this means in this community in particular, barriers towards getting care. And just for context, you know, there are things that people can do to help prevent or delay some of the aging issues that can either just be like regular aging, or things like that meet criteria for setting a dementia diagnosis. And so some of those things include sleep, a healthy diet, reduction in alcohol and tobacco products, you know, mental exercises, social activity, like we're doing now. And I know that sometimes getting into programs like these can be difficult. I'm just curious, if there have been things that helped you or hindered you in terms of addressing some of these risk factors say for worse and aging.

12:49
Vicky: I can kind of relate to some of that because my name is Vicky. Because I've been having a hard time now. Especially with forgetfulness and being sickly also. I could go to different doctors, and I can't even remember they asked me what's the medication and stuff I'm taking? I don't remember it. And then I don't know what if for what. And he's like you've been taking this medicine and you don't know if you're taking the right medication. I say well, if y'all gave it to me. It should be alright. But it bothers me because I know I'm getting the age but I'm like still, I shouldn't be forgetting what I'm taking on why I'm taking and the nurse comes to see me and she would be like did you take this, did you take that?  I don't know. So then that's when my kids decided to buy me those.

13:56
Teri: I was gonna say the little thing to put on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

14:00
Vicky: morning night yeah.
Chana: I got one of those
Vicky: And I hate doing it because it makes me make me feel much older than I am and I just like I can't keep doing it. So my daughter told me yesterday she was like Mom, where's your medicine thing? We haven't filled it up. I say cuz I am taking it.  it bothers me it really it stays on me it gets on my nerves. Yeah,

14:30
well I'm Donna

Donna: and when she said that she doesn't know what medicines she take. You know what I do? I got it on my phone. It's in my notes

14:42
No, no, no,

14:44
Donna: I just brought it here. So I have it in the notes and I have all the milligrams and what it's for and everything like that. So when they when they asked me what medications you take, pull up my phone number here goes right here. Great app.

15:03
Mike: I am easier than donna, Donna
Tony: Oh really, I just took pictures.
Mike:  I lined them up and on. I just took a picture of it. So when I go to see my physician, go like that Nope. Because I know I'm going so that's

15:21
Chana: a good idea. I'm glad I'm Chana. I'm glad my doctor, my cardiologist, she knows me well. So she knows what medications she has described to me. And plus with Brigham and Women's, they have Gateway

15:45
Teri: my chart today,

15:46
I'm sorry, I got there.

15:51
Chana: But as far as memory things, I'm having problems with that now. I'm only 58. But sometimes I forget what day we are in and it is kinda scary. Because I'm about to be on my own. Like, I'm going into my one bedroom. No more kids living with me. So I'm hoping that everything will be okay. While praying that everything is  gonna be okay. Because there's

16:23
Tony: do you feel like there is extra pressure, you know, with everything with your kids and what your role?

16:28
Chana: It's only extra pressure with this. My youngest, my youngest one. I had to put her out. Well, her and her baby. It ain't  the baby it was her. I had to do what I needed to do. She was gonna. I had two heart attacks, and she was the cause of one. I couldn't do it no more.

17:03
Tony: If I am hearing you correctly, it's this fear that intertwines and mixes with this feeling like what's going to happen is my memory gets worse. What I can do, I can no longer I can't do any longer later down the road with especially if people you're looking out for

17:20
Teri: we just have to adapt to different things. I write stuff down, do what you have to do for you, in order to remember stuff. Because the same thing with me, I live alone, you know what I'm saying? So it's like, like I said, I write stuff down anyway. But even now like if I'm running errands, I take it out of my, my daily plan I write today he's been doing, and I write down a post it and I bring it with me in the car. So because sometimes you forget, like doggone it, I forgot, but it was right there in front of you. You know, sometimes you have to acclimate to different things. I didn't used to have to do this, but I got to do it now. It is what it is. You know, we got to do what you got to do. In

17:58
Mike: In the last year, since covid, Mike. Oh, I'm sorry. I

18:07
Vanessa: I just want to know, how can I share? Well, as far as I want to piggyback and
Tony: can you say your name. I'm sorry.
Vanessa:  I'm Vanessa. Just my first time responding here. But I wanted to piggyback on what you said about medication. I was taking the sardines 100 milligrams. And I didn't realize that it was that it was extreme. So now it was such a positive image in my eye.

18:34
So it is

18:37
Vanessa: nice. Like to have the medication that I was I didn't I really enjoy the case as opposed to holding on to one yes.

18:57
Vanessa:  Yesterday I went to the Dr.’s office and I told him I ain’t taking no 100mg, that is extremely too high. Cuz it was causing me problems, and I hope down the line I am gonna be okay. It was affected my memory, my anxiety. It was it triggering my asthma. It was it was doing a lot. Ya

19:18
Teri: you know, the doctors can adjust whatever, you just have to let them know and sometimes people don't let their doctor know. Well they prescribed is to me. So I gotta take it. But yeah, but you have to let them know that it's affecting you in a certain way. So that way they can, you know, adjust the dose or whatever. it all depends on the other medications that you're taking. That's why you know, they need to know all the medications you're taking because there might be an interaction between this and this but ya know, if it's making you not feel good, you got to let them know and be like, Yo, you got to adjust this dose cuz this ain't happening.

19:52
Tony: On that note, I Oh, were you about to say something?

19:54
(unknown): No, I was just gonna say what the lasagna because my girlfriend They had her on it. And it killed her. It's a bad medication for blood pressure. Well, they took me off it too. But I like it depends on what your other medication?

20:15
Mike: Because becasue Thank you, thank you for adding that last part. Because, you know, any medication unintentionally or intentionally misused, or anything where I mean, we're drinking anything you put in your body is going to have a reaction. But the question that I would put on the table, you know, is, you want to know who knows everything about all your medications? Your pharmacist. Yes, yeah. And I mean, I've got someone in my life, who has multiple doctors, but the same pharmacist, and we've gone to pick up her meds, her pharmacist has pulled her aside and said, let's talk about why are you taking this one? This one? This one? Because this one here doesn't work? Well, with this one. Yeah. And has literally written her notes to go back to her doctors to say, explain this to me. So the number one person, is your pharmacist,

21:18
Teri: and they can give you a printout too. Yeah. Yes, definitely.

21:23
Mike: So don't be afraid to. I mean, a lot of folks I've met over the years are uncomfortable questioning their doctor, because that's the doctor. But your pharmacist, oh, man, she'll pull up a chair a heartbeat, you know, and explain it to you,

21:39
you know, on that topic of

21:42
that, too.

21:45
Tony: Now, I think that this, this kind of spirit is also what we're trying to capture, too, and how we can bring people together to come up with solutions. Going back a little bit, because, you know, we've been talking about that interaction, and when we get care, and I'm curious if folks could talk more on, you know, what that's been like, if you've thought about getting care for your memory, not that I'm saying anyone should, because honestly, everyone here is here, because it hasn't been a big enough issue where you, you know, have a diagnosis. But when you used to have even thought about getting care or an opinion about you know, is this a memory related change, is that a problem I should be thinking about, or even getting care for, say your general health because I said before, you know, physical health, sleep, diet, and all those other lifestyle factors can also play a role in terms of our brain health.

22:32
Teri: Well, actually, I guess you know, how you'd say like, you gotta nip it in the bud. So I've done like other memory studies where they've done like, the, the EKGs, and the, what's going on, with MRIs and things like that. And then also, too, I just finished Tuesday, the eighth week, healthy brain, study of whatever, you know, things like that, and where they teach you how to do certain things. And certain, like, you know, your diet and getting enough sleep, and certain foods that you know, work with, you know, you need, whether it be copper, I just be a diet or whatever. And just different things for you to get in the habit of doing in order to help like the brain and like you said, like, with the alcoholor smoking or whatever, all those things that have an effect. So doing these different studies and coming to these different groups, you get little tools to use to be like, Okay, I gotta stop doing this, or do more this or eat more that lets it is so whatever. So it helps you so that way, you don't, you know, necessarily get Alzheimer's or dementia, or maybe you can prolong it or might not be as bad or whatever. So, yeah, so ya know, when you notice stuff, you got to kind of nip it in bugs like I'm getting.

24:00
Dorothy: My name is Dorothy. I've been noticing that. My kids telling me that I repeat. I said, stop. Don't tell me. Let me go with my little repeating. We all do that. Yeah, you don't say? And I'll say like you said, Brenda.

24:21
Dorothy: No, no, no. Yeah,

24:27
Dorothy: I do. Yeah, stuff like that, or store anything in like, like she said, I've been trying to get into programs. I don't know if I want to go into like into MRIs and stuff like that. But he's been constantly worried about me forgetting stuff. And sometimes people say it's your medicine.
Tony:
Dorothy: Yeah. So it started about maybe 10 years when I started taking medicine for depression. So when the doctor was like, you want to be feeling better or you want to forget stuff so you know, but he's getting continually You know, but again, the little things I can't spelling. Oh, yeah, I can't even spell. So you know it is getting really kinda of bad.

25:13
Mike: my big complaint now is an AI system, we have AI, which, which finishes sentences for you. And um, you know, I've learned I've got to go back and reread, reread, because some of the things it looks like a third grader just typed it like, that's not what I was gonna say. Sometimes I'm in such a hurry, and I hit send.  And someone will respond, and I reread and I'm like, oh, what the hell

25:45
Tony: you know, another thing I was thinking about, you know, you brought the Losartan. And I think, you know, healthcare is has, in some ways tried to address, you know, how can we deliver health care that is specific to populations, and even when I went through medical school training, they would change gears in terms of like, okay, you know, with this race day, like with the black population, we might want to start with like, Losartan, or like hydrochloric dyes, you know, and different things. And then it kind of switched gears a few times, confuse me, in terms of like, which carriers should be delivered to which race or ethnicity, but I just am pivoting to this idea of like race and ethnicity as an identity. And I'm curious, you know, when you think about your identity, say, as like a black person or as in a senior, how has that affected you know, your understanding of, say, memory related issues, chronic pain, or your relationship to those issues, or getting paranoid sometimes seeing some head nodding here, because we want to say something

26:45
Tony: nervous, just thinking, Could you say,
Genie: My name is Janie, um, I had to take a special route to go to my sister's house in Everett. And I actually forgot which way I was going. And I had to pull over to think where, which way I that I was going, and that really bothered me? Quite a bit. It still does, because I have a cousin. He's only 74. And he has dementia already. So that's like really troubling for me to forget where I was going. And I had to pull over just to figure out,
Tony: was

27:29
Tony: that the first time you had really?
Genie: Yeah.

27:34
Mike: I'm curious how, when was the last? What was the distance between the last time you were gone? And that time? Did you go like every week? No, everybody,

27:43
Genie: I know the route, you know, the route? I mean, I know. Yeah, I know the route. Yeah, cuz that's how I go to our house.

27:50
Mike: And I gotta say this. Thank you so much. He goes, I got a cousin. He's only 74.

27:56
Mike: But thank you for that.
Tony: Are memory issues like commonly talked about, say, like in the black community when it comes to like fear of dementia and things like that?
Donna: Not really. Really? I

28:10
Donna: don't think so. But, but like she said, Dorothy said, they're always the kids will always be like, Oh, you just said that, you said that, like so. So in that, in that, in that instance, it is, but as far as like, you know, go to your doctor, and they're, like, telling you about, so like, I go to my doctor, I'm gone. I go to my doctor, and then I say, you know, I've been forgetting a lot of stuff. And they say Oh, that's normal. You know, it's just because your age and stuff like that is nothing. But I do the Alzheimer's research study. So I did the PET scan the MRIs, and CAT scans, all kinds of stuff, and do the infusions and everything in the testing. And sometimes when I'm doing the testing, was like, they'll sit up there in my mind, it just goes somewhere. And then they are saying a list of different things, and I'm like, okay, 123 even one the dresser, table? Yes. Yes. The table. That's the floor, the ceiling. Yeah. And then they're like, Okay, now repeated back. And I'm like, Oh, shoot. So I get like, maybe four or five of them. 20 of them, but you know, but it's like and then I'm simply like, Well, damn what? Am I doing good. Am I doing bad? Yeah, so it's kind of scary.

29:34
Tony: And even started this

29:36
Donna:  and my mother and my grandmother had Alzheimer's and that's another reason why I do the studies. You know, like a lot of black people don't do the studies and everything like that. And we need to find out about this. See that? When they do the infusions and stuff, this medication, they don't let you know if you're getting the placebo or the medication. But if you aren't getting the medication and is helping, you know, then it can be helpful to other people. You know, that's generation. Yeah. You

30:05
Mike: You know, actually, if you are getting the medication and it is working, then they have to open the study up to everybody, they unblinded. But um, I'm do you get, a show of hands? How many people here have ever taken a memory test? All right. And you knew ahead of time you were going to take the test, right? You didn't walk in and they go, Oh, could you do this for us? You knew ahead of time? Did you get a little anxious about it?

30:34
Teri: Because you'd be like Oh lord

30:37
Mike: right, I just thought it was.
Tony: I have seen that happen before where like it kinda of get thrown in with your like your primary check ups, or something like that. And I can see just like how people's blood pressure rises, when they're seeing the doctor. Anxiety kicks in, you're like, oh, no, what does this mean for me? And this score? And what does it mean for my future and stuff like that?
Mike: And

30:58
Mike: how your tooth stops hurting the minute you are seating in the dentist's chair, right. Okay, so test anxiety. That's what I was wondering.

31:06
Tony: You know, and another reason, you know, we're talking about memory related issues. Besides that, it's important is, there's a kind of relationship with chronic pain to where chronic pain can actually worsen some of your memory and thinking abilities, because some of the pain can cause a state of like anxiety or stress or fear or tension. And alternatively, you know, some of the memory related issues can worsen chronic pain symptoms as well. So I'm curious, not that I'm trying to say this is a fact for everyone, but has anyone here like notice a relationship say with like, you know, even anxiety being in the middle, but like, chronic pain flayers and remembering stuff, or remembering stuff, and just feeling like that pains is kicking in again, I'm

31:52
Vicky: going through it right now. I'm going through it right now. I first of all, I just had surgery a couple  weeks ago on my eye, then I've had to go back last week, I had to go back I was in so much pain, I could hardly walk. And the pain is so bad. Plus, I suffer with lupus, fibromyalgia. And I take a whole lot of medication. And it has me nervous, I have an appointment tomorrow. And I'm sitting here, and I'm scared to go. I don't know what I might have forgotten. I'm just nervous. And they told tell me. I'm gonna need two surgeries, when I had a knee replaced. And when I had my knee replaced, I went into congestive heart failure. And the same knee, they got to go in to take apart out, then I have to, they have to close me up, get another piece ready and go back in. And I suffer with a blood clots. So it makes me get forgetful. It puts me in this fear. I take they given me medication for this depression. And I'm like, that makes me think it's taking me in a whole different.
Tony: That is a lot of directions.
Vicky: Yeah, and I don't, my prayer was to be able to see my kids get grown my babies for it. My baby is going to be 44 tomorrow.
Everyone: Congratulations
Vicky: and grandkids and other stuff. So about six of them get grown. And my kids don't want me to have this surgery because they're saying it's such a high risk. But I'm saying they don't feel the pain my body's in. And if it's for me to go, I'm gonna go but if it's for him to keep me here, I'm gonna still be here. Yeah. So I'm fighting with my kids. I'm fighting with my mind. I'm fighting. I'm just, it has me. That's why I was determined to try to make this meeting.

34:13
Mike: so it is a quality of life versus quantity. Yeah, yes. Yeah.

34:19
(unknown): I just I do feel your pain. I'm scared by you because I had a new placement back in 22. And they in July 12 They have to go back into it. I I'm sorry. I just I get so emotional. I'm afraid too. I don't want to have this the surgery either. But there is nothing, is not getting any better and it's not getting any worse. You know? It can't help me bend.  If somebody was to accidentally bumped into me, I'm going to keep falling. So I have, my balance is so weak. Yeah.

34:56
Vicky: Do I have a rollator? Okay, and I don't never bring it up. That's, that's a job for me. What if in anything, and to get it up and bring it down? And, and I'd rather just listen, I was

35:11
going in bat for you.

35:14
(unknown): And it gets you tired. it's like working in a gym. Just like moving and walking around.

35:22
Mike: I'm just clarify as we say rollator, you mean the walker. Yeah. Yeah, so you can sit down, right. And

35:33
Tony:  I notice a few things I heard a second ago too. But there was one thing that was mentioned with this, like conflict around medical decision making sometimes with surgeries. And is that is that a thing? You know, typically, when it's like, you have to make a big decision about your life saved even with like pain or memory care. Given those lifestyle factors I mentioned, that tension about this person says, I got to do this thing, but I want to do this thing.
Vicky: And

35:56
Vicky: the worst part is, though, um, Tony is one doctor say, now the doctor who did my knee replacement. He said, Never again, he say because it’s no promise what the next one will do, because I need the left one done too, I head right one done and that's the one they get to go back in. And then had to go, he left and I got another doctor. And they are telling me the man stuck a needle in my arm, and my leg and my knee trying to find fluid to pick up how much something that goes in your body. And it spreads, it's I can't think of what to call it now. And they want to see if it's spread into my body. And he that's what makes you that takes me through when I can't remember what I'm trying to say. But and he stuck and stuck and stuck all in my bone and they couldn't do nothing to num it down or calm it. And I couldn't walk for three days.
Chana: That's a lot.
Vicky: And it just is scary. And I understand my kids, but they don't understand me. Because they could get up and go and do what they have to do. And then I don't want them to have to take care of me. So  it is a hardship, it is a lone battle, so I am hoping that tomorrow it’s something that I could come to a conclusion with.

37:40
Dorothy: I had all these problems you all you guys had just said recently, my she said back in 2000 and something I had my right leg done. I was walking down the street, just going across the street, my leg gave out. So it was so bad. And then I had to get a knee replacement this leg. That’s why I told you I had two knee replacements. And then it got good, then I had to do this one, because this knee was as worse as the old knee. So they did it and I'm just you know, trying to get back in shape. Now the pain is like, I can feel the knee. They said when you get a new one. They're done. You can, it's different than replacing. But it's going good. I was so scared, and I live by myself, I wanted to move.

38:33
Dorothy: I was like I don’t want to be here by myself. It is scary being an elderly person.

38:38
Vicky: I Had my knee replacement, and I was in the hospital for three months.

38:44
Tony: was that during COVID times,

38:45
Vicky: I had it in 2015.

38:48
Tony: You know one thing that was there anyone else wanted to say something but there was something else I was thinking about? You know, you're talking about how during that period, it was scary. And you're also you know, praying for some outcome. And I'm curious what people will think about when it comes to prayer and well being because a lot of times, especially from my training, there's been kind of like a disconnect between saying like our religious and spiritual leaves, and what we do we say in the clinical setting, and I'm also raising this because we're thinking about, you know, how are we going to make this this therapy work for everyone and what to include. And one of the things that you know, I sometimes hear is this idea of prayer being important John

39:41
Teri and Vicky: you know, yes, yes. No, doctors hands. They got to do with all exactly

39:50
Vicky: you know what, I noticed that is true Teri, because I went in for a colonoscopy ended up in a three hour surgery.

40:00
Teri: Oh, Jesus.
Tony: Was there like communication about that? Or was it something?
Vicky: It

40:05
Vicky: wasn't nothing. Like I told you, I take the cool minute, so I have to go in and go on Heparin before they couldn't do it. So I was in the hospital three days before, I had a colonoscopy. But then she went in, and they know I've always had this on them to call it a thing, but it's sitting on a wall. Yeah. But it can't be moved, they can't take it off, because it's so big down in it, and she cut it and cut down two inches into my colon.

40:43
Mike: Which is why Yeah, that's why you got the emergency surgery.

40:49
Teri: See, those are the things you pray for that not that bad. And when you when they put you onto this, a lot of people that see it to be put under, you know, when they see it, they're not gonna, you know, come out of it or whatever, things like that. So you know, you gotta say, uh, whatever. Whatever, whatever. You say your prayer, whatever be like, Lord, let everything go right. And I heal or, you know, nothing goes wrong during surgery, or they don't find something males or whatever, because a lot of things happen. You know, when they open you up, they be like, Yeah, we opened you up, and we found this, this and this. So, you know, like, you went in for one thing, and and they talking about, well, we have to do this, that. And so a lot of times that happens when

41:30
Vicky: people saw and I thank God, when I woke up, I was still here, I woke up. Yeah. And when they told me I was like, and I had told my kids, I don't need nobody to come to the hospital for a colonoscopy. So I was going to be down there for like, 30-45 minutes. And they kept calling. And when I got back to the floor after that not enough recovery. They was like your kids wants want someone to call them. Do you want us to call your kids and say, yeah, and let them know that I'm fine. God brought me through. I prayed and he kept his word and he kept me, It was for me to be here.

42:04
Teri: for the colonoscopy somebody supposed to come pick you up?
Everyone: Yeah,

42:08
Vicky: I wasn't coming home because they have to put me back on my Coumadin.

42:15
Mike: Which is what threw off your kids? Because they know that the routine usually is who's gonna go pick up mom.

42:23
Vicky: Now, they know they can’t pick me up.  Cuz I have been on Coumadin for 40 years.

42:31
Vicky: I mean, they know the routine. Yeah, they know. That and heard from me.

42:40
Tony: Before I switch gears, I'm curious, does anyone else have anything they wanted to share? Thoughts that?

42:45
Brenda: I want. I want to say, a lot, as lot of people, and I know one of my god daughters had knee surgery, and they had to go back in. And then she had to have other knee done. And they had to go back in. So I mean, is this like something that the doctors messing up on? Or is it the things that they put in your knee replacements or whatever because it's a lot of a lot of people have to go back for knee replacements is not good
Mike: and hip replacements

43:25
(unknown) because I have to have much change? And it's only been two years. Yes. See?

43:29
Brenda: And then it shouldn't be long. It should last longer than that. You know, in my back I have bad back problems in my in my hips and you know I mean I don't care how bad they hurt I ain't get no surgery. I will seat in this chair and fly up and down the street and keep on going. They ain’t doing no more cutting on me.

43:54
Teri: A lot of people feel that way too. Especially when you get older and age and stuff. Like are they ain’t opening me up? Yeah, so yeah, more likely to feel that way. You know, seeing that? That was the worst? Yeah.

44:06
Donna: Like you know, like I'll be sweeping the floor and then it's like

44:09
Donna: oh my back

44:10
Donna: I gotta go sit down. So I can sleep like that one yeah, then I gotta go sit down and then I can get back up and start doing it again. It took me so long to clean up in the back surgery I was like always on the go and doing everything and like at the time I lived by myself now I'm my nephew just moved in with me and it's it's even worse because I gotta clean up behind him it's good to move in I got enough going on my step stepping up and everything like that. But yeah, the back surgery. My daughter her back so she had cancer then she had back surgery. But her back she her hers came out fine. She's doing great with it. And, yes, she's younger, and then I'm all bent over and everything. And then I just had COVID, like a couple of months ago. And after I had the COVID It's like, it is I have, I've learned to develop asthma at 60. And after I had COVID, it's like, you breathing so hard and everything like that? I mean, I want to schedule a doctor's appointment, then they're like, Okay. You had COVID in March, we can give you an appointment in July. July, I mean appointment soon, because my breathing and stuff and find out why it's affecting me like that. Can you get me in there sooner, we get a call every day. So I have to call it every day to see if somebody somebody cancelled the appointment. I can get in there it's crazy.

45:59
Mike: No part of, you know, Donna, this is my this is my my, my pet peeve with that is the lack of urgent care clinics that are in some neighborhoods in urgent care on every corner. And I mean, a couple of us were sitting down one day and we're like, Where are their urgent care?
Everyone: Yeah,
Mike: and in the neighborhood. And it was like the closest one we could think of is that old Jiffy Lube and denim with a rotary one? Yeah, I'm not making I'm not talking about the hospitals that have urgent they call them urgent care, quote, unquote, instead of the emergency room.

46:38
Teri: Like a separate one that they have, and

46:41
Chana: Cambridge and stuff like

46:44
Mike: Go outside the and city limits. You think I am joking. That's my point. Yeah. There there are no no, there's there's two downtown by the transportation building. Not a shameless plug, but one is a Mass General building. And then you go a little bit further down. And there's another one I think it's Beth Israel, urging this literally to downtown by the transportation from one

47:07
Chane: One in central square, go on Commonwealth Avenue. There's another one over there. They used to have one Whitney Street Clinic but they closed down.
Mike: I did not know that

47:17
Mary: I have noticed the same thing. I live in Cambridge. And so like whenever I drive into this side like it, I feel like the vibe changes, don't even like I like to Cambridge like when you walk five minutes and Whole Food,  You want five minute there is a cvs.

47:42
Mary: Drive for 10 minutes now when I even see one single okay.
Mike: Just just as going along with chronic pain and fitness. Guests care to guess because this is something else. We were trying to figure out how many fitness centers we have in the neighborhood. I don't know if it's still there, but I know whitter street had one in their basement. And then there was a planet fitness in that in that apartment building. Right down the street from Forest Hills. tried to figure out another one
Teri: American Legion

48:12
Teri: highway. And it's a one stop shop. That's right. That's

48:17
right and straight yet River Street. Yep.

48:21
Deposits.

48:23
And they got a woman's fitness right down on top. Common square is a health fitness. Where I'm looking at right there. Right, right next door to daily table. All that's

48:35
right. You go. Oh,

48:36
Mike: yeah, right. Yeah. Oh, that's right, women.

48:42
Chana: We used to go to USB

48:44
Tony: So I love this the way we're just like sharing resources and connecting and other one thing that I was thinking about? I know, Mr. Kincade I, Nomin and Mary, we've been trying to figure out, you know, when we put together this program, where's a good place to have it happen? Because I'm hearing some things about how it's sometimes like you got to go this far to get this program. You know, when we think about having this program be accessible? Are there certain, like types of places that might make it accessible for folks around here?
Teri: You mean this this program?
Tony: Yeah, the program we're trying to meet, not just focus. But when we when we make this program, sorry, I should get some context. So we're trying to put together this program around this known therapy and it's called mindfulness based cognitive therapy. And we'll talk a bit about some of the skills in this program. But we're really trying to redefine this program so that a successful so that it makes sense to people so that includes skills that people want to do, and it's in a place that it's you know, people want to go to and it's given by people that people want to hear from and so you know, sometimes you've probably created some problems awesome. Places like maybe the Kroc Center or Central Boston, or even like at the library space, you know, just curious What places people think about when they, when they think like, this is a place I would go to for like an exercise program or for like, a Mind Body Program, which is like an exercise,
Teri: which is like an exercise programs like

50:13
Chana: where we are at now.

50:16
Teri: Do you need someplace where they have to put a equipment or, you know, already has equipment?
Tony: I love

50:21
Tony: that question. You know, for us don't know what we don't really, you know, a lot of the exercises are probably going to be low intensity. So okay, very similar to what some people consider like yoga. Oh, you know, so like, we would just have like mats, so no equipment are necessary. Okay. It's mostly like kind of these like bodyweight exercises?

50:38
Teri: Oh, well, the different libraries and different maybe it all depends on how long this program is going to be. So that way, people are not saying well, why is it always going to be at this library I live over here. So maybe you have different, you know, date or whatever like this, oh, a couple of weeks, we'll do it at the Dudley library a couple of weeks, we'll do it here different all different locations, or, you know, that have the space that you need, yeah, or different, maybe a couple of weeks, we haven't at the Mattapan library or whatever. So you know, things like that. So that way, you know, what's in each person's neighborhood in like, you know, some people with transportation issues or whatever, or just like, you know, like, I wanted to be in my neighborhood next to me, you know, I'm just saying, you know, so maybe do it a couple of weeks, see a couple of weeks there, or whatever. Yeah, or take a poll with people that I would you come and where would you like it to be in have the different places and see what gets the most votes and whatever. And they'd be like, okay, just like when you know, you do other things we like, okay, majority roles, this will is going to be this. So this section is going to be at this library. And then when that section finishes, and we're going to do it here or whatever, or even maybe two, it all depends have some stuff outside since the weather's been nice or whatever. Because during COVID We did a lot of things outside, you know, Franklin Park or whatever, something so ya

52:00
(unknown) know, centers and stuff in the library to get back involved in yoga mat. Yeah, have enough room to spread out. So some of the health centers have like rooms that are big enough for that. Doing some cheer yoga and stuff like that.

52:18
(unknown) Yeah, there is a gym cross the crocs, it's on W street. So yeah,

52:23
Mike: yeah, that's how big the Kroc Center?

52:25
Tony: Yeah, I think I went there for the double AARP meeting
Donna: ARP meeting resource.

52:31
Donna: It was just now. Yeah. And then they had the singing and the dancing and

52:35
Donna: everything.
Tony: That was fun. Oh, no. I saw the line dancing, which is a you know, I think for this program, we're really open to different ideas to. And you know, I love this idea of like, all this troubleshooting we're doing with like, where to do it. I'm also curious, you know, when it comes to in person versus virtual, or both, is there any preference there?

52:56
Chana: Well, virtual is hard for me, because I don't really understand technology and learn slowly. My kids get frustrated, because I'm like, can you help me? You know, so I'm the type of person I like to do things. To get me out the house. Yeah. So, but I've been very blessed that I haven't had, I had  back pain and everything. I had two spasms. But I haven't really had no major surgery. The only surgery I had in my life was when they put the stent in to my arm to my heart. That's the only surgery as far as I can remember. And know,

54:00
Tony: it's good to know, I know, sometimes it's a different people have different needs. And that in person element can make it a lot more interactive.

54:08
Dorothy: I'd like in person, but I can't do better with with the virtual because it's hard for me to get in and out. I say what's the pain in my body? So that's

54:20
Tony: good to know. And we conclude that to kind of do we have to do sort of both at the same time. Another thing I was just thinking about is just and you can kind of speak for yourself or even how you think others say like in the black community, maybe some of these concepts but you know, when when you think about yourself or others in your community, terms like meditation, yoga, mindfulness, you think those things are generally accepted, you know, as the way that they're worded or the way that they're delivered.

54:54
Brenda; I think they're very helpful. Yes,

55:00
Mike: we gotta be honest how we told you, you hit it right on the head when you said how it's worded. You know, I think of meditation. Everybody meditates, meditate at some time, but they don't realize they're meditating. That's my point. Yeah. You know,

55:21
Chana: what are you thinking?

55:22
Chana: That's meditate,
Mike: when you're just sitting there relaxing, like, I'm just taking a moment for myself. Yeah, that's meditating. But we don't realize why it's meditating.

55:33
Brenda: it is a difference when you're meditating and you're breathing correctly. And then when you're just meditating seating back, which

55:43
Teri: back, which is meditation exercise, it was just something that

55:47
Mike: of course, we're teachers to breathing.

55:51
Yeah, it's just like

55:53
Mike: the word therapy. A lot of people don't realize that they are therapy is calling their best friend to vent. They think of therapy as sitting in that office, on their couch. And going so tell me what's wrong.

56:08
Teri: And we tell one is the best I think.

56:22
You feel so

56:28
Tony: Mary brought up a good thing too, which is this idea of prayer. And I, you know, I've noticed when I've gone to, you know, the Wednesday or Thursday groups, I love how people pray. And it's just such a powerful moment. And you know, I can't help but feel like my mind enters, say, like, a state of like, concentration, you know, when I'm just sitting there in silence. And not again, I'm trying just to bring this up as an example. But one thing we've been tinkering around with was this idea that, you know, like Mr. Kincaid said, like, sometimes meditation kind of comes in different forms. And it's not always like that picture, cross legged, and so forth. But prayer could also be like an example. But I'm curious, like, What Would y'all consider prayer to be like, even a kind of meditation? Or would you accept it? As a meditation?
Chana: Yeah, I do. Yeah.

57:15
Chana: I call I call when I ride the MBTA, and get on it and just think. to the blue line and just get on in just think, you know, not what nobody else just

57:39
Brenda: get on. And I get scared. Because you get on in everybody's like this.

57:48
Chana: You look around and see what's going

57:52
Brenda: I don’t see not one person look around and see what's going on. And I didn't see not one person looking around. And I don't take the T cuz I usually drive. Anybody could have gotten on there and did whatever and nobody would have seen anything.

58:10
Teri: everybody is always on there like this, minding my business.

58:17
Vicky: I just like to ride the T. But after they changed them, and it's got to be so much violence started going, it’s too much glass on buses. Might not be the one that might catch it. But it terrifies me. Okay, good. Well, what

58:38
Donna: I try to do, because I live alone. So what I try to do is pick the kids on time when the kids aren't in school. And I would get on one free bus get on other free bus, take the trolley and make a circle around. I try not to be outside when the kids are outside, the kids are crazy. To be outside. Yeah.

58:58
Vicky: I think also that, that just made me think of more mental health issues. Because there are a lot of people, you know, especially, you know, in our neighborhood that younger people that have different issues that aren't being addressed. And, you know, they, they ride the tea, they go to school, or they go to wherever, and sometimes something ticks them off and they want to do whatever they want to do. And it's a problem. It's not like, you know, I hate that some of us don't like to ride the T. But, you know, it is it's an issue. It's a problem.

59:36
Donna: What do you think the problem is before you they make the buses free? People are walking. We can walk and think. not everybody's getting a bus. They don't want to walk no more. You know, because it's free. So it's really

59:52
Tony: Yes, I'm here and transportation is also

59:57
(unknown) In my neighborhood I live in Mattapan I do see A lot of people walk in I mean if I was if I was to catch the T on my phone, it will tell me if the bus is crowded or not. So that's when I travel. When I see that the bus is less crowded, that is when I get on the bus. When it is full, I don’t use the T at all.
I was going to say, one thing about technology too. I was in the grocery store. I wanted to buy a watermelon. I wasn't quite sure if it was you know, the watermelon was ripe. So I asked the gentleman in the produce department I said, Is this watermelon? You know, ripe to buy, you know, I don't I don't know what's the difference between sweet and no. He said google it.

1:00:51
Mike: you obviously was not in Whole Foods
(Unknown): it is sad how everybody is into their phone, we don't we don't communicate with each other. Brenda: Yeah,
(Unknown): even I could be having an asthma attack and I'm just like
Brenda: google it

1:01:11
(unknown): yeah,
Chana: I, I almost hit to two three people walking across the street on their phone. And it’s like, I would rolled down the window and on say watch where you are going. Okay, that phone is not important. It's not important. And then this little boy arrives at common square, by the Walgreens. One little boy, okay, from a distance. I saw one little boy go across the street on his little scoter. So I said, Okay, he's gone. all the sudden another little kid, he hit. He hit my car, I did not him, he hit my car. And I'm like, but I almost got out and beat him. But I had to think about it because in today's world you cannot do that. And I am like, you cannot hit this kid, right off the sidewalk. He didn't look, nothing. And, and I'm like, you can't you can't just do that. Okay? It's like, Damn, if you take the T damn if you drive. Damn if you walk. Because people let their dogs walk freely. I have a real fear of dogs. I think I fear that I'm gonna die if a dog bites me. I just had that feeling. Because I got bitten so many times when I was younger. Why? Probably because I was messing with the dog. But now it's like, I'm scared of dogs seeing people with their Pitbulls. Especially those things. They walk way ahead of them. You know.

1:03:16
Tony: you know, in the subject of walking, I am really glad we ae talking about this. But we're also thinking about what kind of exercises might be applicable for this kind of program. You know, and I know some programs have like walking exercises. So you know, when you think about this, again, this being a program around some of the mindfulness and meditation, the yoga, the physical exercises, and the Talking is would like a walking therapy, kind of like maybe like walking together.

1:03:43
Chana: It'd be part of it. Not

1:03:45
Chana: not the street

1:03:50
Mike: there's walking clubs that Ben Franklin

1:03:52
Teri: I was gonna say they tried the

1:03:57
Chana: Franklin part is 2 and half miles. I did it. I did it a couple of times and said no. But I needed it.

1:04:17
(unknown). They got the steps. Yeah, you know, yeah, steps they take it each day. Yeah.

1:04:21
Teri: But I just wanted to bring this up that this is part of our eight week of healthy brain study. And these are some people that like, you know, because like some people who have trouble like falling asleep, they listen to those things, whether it be the waves or whatever, whatever. So each week they had us do like different types of mindful things or whatever. So these are some of those is mindful awareness of breath. Then they have another one called body scan. Then another one mindful, stop mindful eating, bringing awareness to unwanted feelings, and then loving kindness and urge surfing So each, you know, recording, to talks about different things that whatever, and they all start off like getting to a comfortable place, right? Close your eyes, whatever. And then they have like, you can pick whether you want the man voice, or the woman's voice, you know, whichever one you feel it's more soothing. And they want you to listen to those every single night. And then they ask you, like, you know, how did you feel after you listen to it or whatever. So each one of these does like different things. And over the eight weeks, you know, they asked you like, well, how have you been feeling since you've been listening to the mindfulness recordings and things like that, but they are very soothing. And the ones that make you pay attention to your breath and different parts of your body and trying not to let your mind go. And it'll even say, in the recording, like, if you feel your mind going try to come back, you know, they know what's going to happen, you know, so they even tell you that, you know, in the recording, if you feel your mind, go and try to bring it back to you, whatever, whatever you know, and it's real soon, will soothing. So those are the different things that they have. So

1:06:12
Chana: I sleep.
Mike: So let me make a suggestion. Why don't you share that contact information for that study with Tony and Tony can share it. Okay. Yeah.

1:06:23
Teri: Yeah, they where at UCB the other week.

1:06:25
Chana: I haven't seen UCB open on the app yet. Oh, lately.

1:06:30
Teri: Oh, okay. Yeah, where you the one that said that you were going to try the study? And I said, I'm in that study. Is that Ryan’s Study. Yeah. Right. It was that is that?

1:06:43
Mike: That was the first time we brought Ryan to UCB.

1:06:48
Tony: we have an opportunity to even start from scratch. Yeah, I'm curious, you know, when you think about getting these recordings, these materials, these, these sound bites and so forth. What would make you appreciate them more, you know, in a way that wouldn't make you feel alienated? Or this isn't for me and so forth?

1:07:09
Chana: I never been, I never felt alienated need from anything. Even if I don't befriend you, you. I'm gonna still have fun. By myslef.

1:07:21
Teri: I don't understand your question.
Tony: No, I love that reframing a different way. This also relates to like, who the instructors might be. And sometimes people have preferences in terms of who their instructor is, say like, oh, like my, my parents who are Asian, they kind of prefer like a Vietnamese doctor. Okay. They prefer someone that understands Vietnamese culture. And so I'm curious, like, when you're getting say, like, these recordings, or even you're receiving the instruction? Is there ever like a preference like this person's from the community? This person?

1:07:58
Teri: Yes. Yes.
(unknown): As long as it is somebody that you can understand. Because like, you could you get all the phone calls and everything and somebody's like, I don't know, how you're doing. I don't need you.

1:08:14
In a way that's understandable. And

1:08:16
the person, you know, I don't want to be seat up here with. I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but Indian person and they try to give me instructions and stuff.
Tri: Yeah,
Unknown: and I can’t even understand what the person is saying. And you're trying to tell me how to do something. Yeah. You know, like, yeah, it's always

1:08:37
Teri; it is always better for people that are part of your community, and understand us and understand certain things or whatever. That's why I notice a lot of black people are getting into the, like yoga and different Pilates of different meditation things, and then the sound bowls and all that stuff. Because it's kind of like the thing, it's like, you know, like, we go through a lot of stuff. So we need this, and this, you know, so they can relate. And it's always good to be with somebody that you can relate to. So that's my big, you know, our, around our age or whatever, not somebody who's really, really young, it's like, you don't understand what I mean, as close as you can get, because if there's nobody out here, but someone closest to our age and from the community that can relate and, you know, whatever, it can do things for certain levels, like, you know, just like what anything, you know, it's like all these dis exercises for the more younger people, but I have one for the old, you know, somebody that has a variety of things to you know, in order to offer instead of you go in there and maybe trying to have us do

1:09:46
Tony: so, yeah, so, having someone that you can relate to

1:09:52
Mike: So you, you said multiple things there. And so let me go there in my life Lifetime. I know I am not the only one here. I have sat in a room and had people speak to a group and realize they have no clue what that what they're what? No, they have no clue about who they're talking about. Right? It's like a lie. Read the room. And I will and I will admit this, those people have been an every shade of the rainbow? Yeah. Whereas I've had people who were not black, coming to the black community. And I'm sitting there like, Damn did he grow up on blueline.  Because where I'm going with that is because he or she came correct. And so there's, there's a respect, reading the room, understanding your audience. And now my dad's gonna come up my mom. Growing up, my father believed that the best doctor had to be white. Now, I remember this one going years ago, I was on a panel at the Boston University School of Medicine. And we had a young black doctor, he was the only black doctor on the panel. And the room was basically older, black folks, predominantly women. And one of the masses, young man, what medical school he went to. Now they didn't ask anybody else on it. And he said, Howard University. And she went Oh, so you didn't go to a real medical school. I'm not making that up. I still remember that. But the thing that I loved about how that young man responded, he didn't go. He said, trust me, Howard medical school was very real and very hard. And then his colleagues supported him. Other doctors supported him. But where I'm going with this, is that that those that question? I could picture my old man asking that question. Because, you know, he, that's just the era that he grew up, boy,

1:11:55
what school you went to.

1:11:59
Mike: I'm a product of the 60s 70s. My dad was much later. But my point where I'm going with this is I remember getting into a debate with my dad in the 70s about being black. And he went I’m colored. And I'm like, No, you're not, you're black. This is if you remember, the 70’s, and he said boy, it says I'm colored on my birth certificate. And when I die, I'm gonna be colored.
Chana: on my birth certificate it says Nigro.
Mike: As does mine. No, I take that back. It says colored. Boston city, mine says colored. But my point is, is that if you come to the community, correct? No, and you have no idea. I mean, y'all know me. I've brought multiple different people UCB things and everything like that. And one of the questions and this young man sitting across from me asked me the same question, is it going to be a problem? Because I'm not black? Almost every single one of them have asked me that. And my answer is, as long as you understand respect, you're good.

1:13:12
Chana: I has a problem with this nurse at Brigham and Women. I back back then back then. In my records, I

1:13:25
Chana: had recovering addict

1:13:29
Chana: She brought that up, the nurse, and I am like, why? I get defensive. Why are you bringing that up? What I'm not here for that. I'm here for my heart problem. And you know, so she says he says, Oh, well, we need to. I'm a patient already inside. I've been there for three, four days. They put me on another floor. And she said, Do you have any drugs on you? Do you have any gun? I knew I just blew up on her.  I just blew up because I'm like, why do you think I am in this hospital with a damn gun. You know. And she called security because I blew up on her. And I'm like you could call whoever you want to call. Okay. But don't ask me those questions. They didn't ask me that question in emergency. Right? They didn't want to check my bags, because she wanted to check my bags.
Teri: Oh, wow.
Chana: You know, I said don't come back in my room. If you come back to my room, I'm blessing you.

1:14:48
Chana: That is what I told her. I never seen her again.

1:14:51
Teri: and It won't be the type of blessing

1:14:59
Chana: I was there three days
(unknown): now which hospital?
Chana: Brigham and women
Teri: Oh, wow.

1:15:03
Tony: Do you think that was coming from a lack of respect, or like stigma discriminate?
Chana: Yeah, because she was coming from, because

1:15:10
Chana: she was looking at my history. Like I was not there for drugs I had, I was having anxiety. My chest was hurting. And they kept me. And so I was down in emergency for three days, and then they found a bed for me at the cardiologists in the other building. And that's what she did. You know,

1:15:40
Vicky: I understand just what you're saying, because I had a nurse. And I don't know, she gave me a hard time and it was a day I was getting discharged. Yeah. And she gave me my medication. And at that time, I was taking Oxycontin. And she gave it to me. And so I had a couple more hours we put my son would get there to pick me up. So about an hour before he was to get that she came back in the room. And she was giving me you're not up and dressed and just after No, I'm waiting on my son. She said, Well, I'm giving you your medicine now. So when you get home, when my son came back, I was code blue. She don't practice nursing no more.

1:16:32
Tony: Want to say, folks who feel feel free to stay, but I know it's 1:30. So if you have the jet I know life is you know, they'll happen for us. Thank you for coming, Miss Brenda. Thank you.

1:16:47
Mike: Shameless plug how many folks that come into the resource fair Saturday?

1:16:50
I am.

1:16:52
Mike: All right. Oh, that's weird.

1:16:58
Mike: All right. I know, I am going to be there. So make sure you stop by and say, okay,

1:17:01
yeah, no.

1:17:04
Brenda: I went to the coffee hour with the mayor up there and walk apart. And so on Blue Hill Avenue, they getting ready to put the bus stop. In the middle of this? Yeah, I'm sorry. And I told him, you know, that's the worst thing that you could ever do. And then they're like, and then like, Oh, that's it. Have you ever gotten any positive? You know, monsters from that? And they're like, Oh, yes, we got plenty of positive positive. And I said, No, no, no, I do not believe that. Because and then you're gonna tell me, then they told me. Okay, so there's 40,000 People that rise the team, awesome. And what about the residents that are in this area? What are you talking about? Oh, that's what we're talking about. The people that ride the T are in the area and they walk to the T stop. And it's 23,000. Us and so that doesn't even make sense. That's so do so do you live in an area? Do you live in this area, when you want to come in, change everything up for us? We'll take parking away from people that live in an area for years. You got to put this this T stop in the middle of the street, where people are going to get hit. My sister got hit over there on Columbus Avenue. Y'all did that. People get hit. There's all kinds of accidents. It's all kinds of people that are getting off the bus. It's so much so much simpler for people that are catching the bus. To it’s not. I'm seeing people getting off the bus. older ladies getting off the bus, get ready to cross and get hit. You know, so I just don't get an asset. You got plenty of stores on Blue Hill Avenue. And when those trucks come to make their deliveries, what where where cars are gonna go? Yeah. So they're like, oh, in that bus

1:18:54
Teri: in that bus lane. No one around.

1:18:57
Brenda: What we do now call me bus lane. Exactly. And then I gotta go into buckling. And that's my cause and then the way that you have set these lanes up. So if you're coming down the street, and it's two lanes, and then it goes into three minutes. But then one man goes this way. Women goes this way. One man goes over this. But these two lanes when you come down, you don't know that that thing's going that way. So people are so confused when he went to get there. Yeah, you know, and

1:19:33
Mike: so let me jump in. Because I was actually talking to some of the business people up there by Franklin Park .I'm with you on that. I'm like that's gonna be the biggest fiasco. But you got to understand something. First of all. That's before they made those plans that will they had to plan, but they had  community earrings.

1:19:55
Tony: Thank you for coming. (END OF FOCUS GROUP)

1:20:00
Mike: had community hearings, and we've seen these, but they put an ad in a banner, you know, depending on where you live, they may put something in your mailbox, but they have community hearings. The problem is, folks don't show. Let me rephrase it. Long time. Again, neighborhood folks don't show. But the new folks do show up. And they're the ones that are like, Oh, my God, this is amazing, please. Yeah. Now, again, you've seen what happens when folks show up and I'm gonna date myself. Am I  the only one who remembers when they put a no left turn sign down there. And right here in the intersection, you know, that you couldn't turn to go up the hill? Yeah.

1:20:39
Teri: Oh, yeah.

1:20:40
Mike: I remember that sign that went there. I don't remember anybody asking me because back then I lived on deck cards, right? I don't remember anybody asking me about that. And, but then once that sign went up there, you know, Mike's group overhead project, right. You know, the other group, they all galvanized. They went down to the city and like they know exactly, you and that sign was gone. Just like quietly went away. You seen community active? I love that sign I Roxbury Community College that's up there that says if it wasn't for community activism, you'd be on the highway right now. So my point is, they had those hearings. And the people who showed up

1:21:26
the ones that they did want that?

1:21:29
Chana: Because can I'm sorry. Well, before Mayor Menino pass. We did have he did we did have meetings (not sure).
Mike; Yep.
Chana: And they had a model of that look nice. But people, you know, was saying, how's that gonna work? Just like you say people, like, we already don't have nowhere to park because they put these white things up. Which go run over.
Teri: For the bikes.
Chana: ours is plastic but in Cambridge, does are concrete

1:22:04
Chana: I know, I know. We we're up to the

1:22:08
sound like, and I notice, and other little towns, they don't have that. They have a bike lane, but not all that little white stuff. And, you know,

1:22:23
Mike: we live in again, we live in a city that has, okay, I've finally come to the conclusion that they're building Boston, not for the people who lived here. But for people. They are not coming but they want to live. Again. Anybody remember when there was a group trying to change the name of American Legion highway? Because they said it wasn't a highway? Yeah. And then folks had folks because if folks hadn't shown up to say, yeah, it's been American Legion highway since forever. Leave it alone wasn't for that. That would have a new name.

1:22:56
Just like Nubian square down Dudley. Down, that.

1:23:03
If you if you know the backstory on how that happened. Yeah, the reason that they the original reason for changing it for Nubian square. Someone didn't do their homework. Because then when they discovered what the Nubian frog was that they wanted to name it after, didn't quite have a good background. So they they flipped it to say we're naming it after the folks from Nubian notion Gnosis.

1:23:31
Oh, okay. Like you say, Who am exactly why wise, was quite late to Faneuil Hall. Audiences, they thought, yeah.

1:23:47
This is the times that we live. Yeah. And again, as a history buff, I understand. Yeah. All right. I mean, we live in a city, but they have taken down statues all over the country. Army bases all Yeah, welcome to Boston. We we got history here too. Yeah, that folks, we didn't learn about

1:24:07
downtown. Martin Luther King. Yeah, they wasted so much money on that thing. Awesome. chance to look at

1:24:18
it. But you know what? It is a beautiful statue because of the fact. And again, this what do you represent? represent what people don't seem to understand is that if not for Boston, they may not have been a Martin Luther. King, this is where they met because this is they met at BU. Bu still has some of his works in their archives. But my point is, is that if it wasn't for Boston, if it wasn't for 12th Baptist Church, yeah. If it wasn't he used he was a junior pastor at 12 Baptist. The point is, is that this is history that we weren't meant to make. Yeah. So then building that statue. For me, what pissed me off and I will be honest, was the people who were, who were against it and when it came out because of the weight of the design. I mean, there was so much pushback nationally, it was all on Facebook.

1:25:16
Everything it was like a lot because they were saying that's what they spent $100 million, and blah, blah, blah, whatever, what people don't understand what it signifies. And when you look at it from certain ways, like it don't look like it was the Embrace when he won the Nobel Peace Prize, and he was hugging corretta. And that's what it is his arm and then they're like that. Wait a minute, wait.

1:25:40
But if you've never seen the photo, and the photo, yes, you don't understand. But then, but on the flip side, and again, I'm gonna date myself. I remember when Mandela came to Roxanne, let me phrase that when Mandela came to Boston, and they wanted to put on his his schedule, a visit to rock which, which again, I'm dating myself, if you all remember when they tried to change the name of Roxbury to Mandela land. That didn't work. Didn't work. And then he comes to Boston, and they're unable to schedule a stop and rocks. Yeah. I was like, Are you sitting there building up to this dude, you could at least drive by and wait.

1:26:32
What's it? What's the presupposing? That Church Cathedral years ago? That Um, okay. The Catholic Church, okay. He came

1:26:49
over Obama

1:26:51
was Obama. When he came? He was he was the free

1:26:54
Oh, not a cathedral. John, sorry. No, it wasn't it wasn't

1:26:58
wasn't the Pope. I know what you're talking about. It was one of the bishops. Yeah, it was one of the bishops.

1:27:06
You know, I remember because my grandmother grabbed me. I was younger. Yeah. She needed to go with that thing. In itself. The Armstrong.

1:27:19
Cardinal, somebody? Yeah, yes.

1:27:23
That was the 70s.

1:27:26
But Obama, Obama has

1:27:27
been bad. Yes. Because Obama was here. That's why what she said to Peter. I was like, No, he was at that Catholic church over there on the street going over there. What's the tea stop over there before you get to Ruggles? No, no, no, no, no mission, mission. Mission Church. Obama was at that one, but this was the embrace. This is what did that is? Oh, okay. Once you see it. That's why people like Well, that's why they should have put their heads on it. You know, I want to see the picture. Now. You can

1:28:04
go in the front. Yeah. What is what is that? So okay, now? When I was looking at, I was still in my car, I think. And then I saw a woman down. And you can see his arm to

1:28:23
him. No, no, yeah. You see his arm with the instrument, and whatever. And the actual thing we did. Okay, but I'm saying the actual picture that it's from, okay.

1:28:36
I never knew that. Yeah. I knew he was here. Yes. It was a breach. And he was the school that I thought they met in Georgia. No, no, we're here because originally from Alabama, right.

1:28:55
I cannot answer where I want. It. might be right. I know. He ended up in Georgia. Okay.

1:29:02
That was in September 79. When the Pope came, right. Yeah, it was. Yeah. Because I had my daughter in the hospital in Boston City Hospital and they closed them off the streets

1:29:15
because they had to street

1:29:21
walk to that church, because yeah, when they used to be when they used to be on the elevator, the

1:29:32
elevator? What better known as the train? Yeah. It's not trying to be fancy. I know. A train.

1:29:42
Remember when he used to go around the corner?

1:29:50
Yeah. Right there. Yeah. You know, it's funny when I grew up here But I went to college in Minnesota and and I am the class of 70s Boston Public School 76 buses class. So I get to Minnesota and white people losing their mind because of all the busing crazy. They thought Boston was basically what you saw from the Kennedys where we all just loved each other. You know, Boston is the most segregated city I've ever been to, like what I'm like, just take the train and you'll see it sometimes worse in the south west. South you know, where you stand exactly what I put out and say and think about this. When a train came on at a tunnel. All the Asians got off at the first stop on

1:30:34
Chinatown.

1:30:37
Next to stops all your, your Puerto Rican. Yeah, and then we got, we got Eggleston? Well, who got off after Eggleston? I'm like, I don't know, I'm blind.

1:30:54
The thing that's funny is and I tell people this, and this is 1976, which to me was not that long ago. But for some people, it was history. I know that. But I still we went to Forest Hill, on the train was in 76, because I was part of we I was part of a group thing. And we were having a party. And so we rode the train to Forest Hills in the house that had the party. His mother had to drive two blocks before it still to pick me up. Because I was to the house for

1:31:27
two blocks. Because that's good. Why is 77 I grew up in Colombia. Oh, you know, it used to be can we put that No, we got walked it. We walk it was a risk. Because you know, the white man would kill

1:31:48
us. You had an Busto my ex husband grew up in Colombia. Number 10.

1:31:52
Number eight was visa go to South by saying they will have to turn off the lights because they always bombed the rocks and stuff. But I remember a couple of people got killed

1:32:05
by my best friend lived in Colombia.

1:32:10
They had to drive to and from work

1:32:22
we had to get police escort Yeah, you missed that school. But if you can't go to school, okay. You also have

1:32:35
more problems here than I did go to school in Framingham to Mecca. I went to school in Framingham all 12 years. I've never had any problems like you people. They don't be calling me out. No, I never had any problems like that out there. But see, I went to South and versus North. North was a little bit more uppity or whatever. But still, it was in Framingham, all 12 years, I never had any problem. They had more problems in this city than I did in the suburbs. I'll deal with them white folks.

1:33:06
But you know, something that's funny, and I think about this, I remember again, date myself. First time I've ever gotten involved in politics. My mom took me to a meeting, a community meeting and Freedom House when Mayor white Kevin while he was having a town hall meeting and spent the summer before busing started here. And ironically, my old director was his aide, who I didn't know. But Kevin White stood on that stage and answered all the questions all night long about and the thing that I remember was he kept telling I need everybody saying, I need everybody to stay calm. I need everybody to be, you know, we got this, it's going to be okay. And I remember turning to my mom and saying, Why does he keep telling everybody to be? And she said because he knows something.

1:33:55
Now, that changed everything like for black people to move in Southie.

1:34:04
He started with the thing was, and again, if you remember the first day of busing, and if you see the photos and stuff, you'll see that but those buses coming up that Long Hill Yeah, that was the buses coming to Roxbury High School where I went yeah. Which we the street was lined full. The cops literally looked like a camp. Yeah, the bike, the motorcycles and everything. And we were all standing around like wow, this is cool. And then the bottle would pull up, open up the doors. No white kids would get off because there were no white kids. And I mean, we only had like four or five but but the point whereas all the guys because Roxbury high had the juniors and seniors Southie had the freshmen and sophomores and so all the cops were in Roxbury. That's why those buses got stolen. The cops were all in Roxbury. There was no one protecting the babies going out to selfie Yeah, when That bus crossed that border folks lost their mind. There was no police. And then we still remember the radios exploding on the for the cops and everybody jumping in the cars and on the bikes taking off, taking off to go. That's why those buses all got got stoned and drunk because there was no police.

1:35:21
They might even understand what's going on. And when you got to your school that was on top of the roof, they have little children stick in a middle fingers up. But

1:35:30
that wasn't no. I mean, those of us who know if you ever went to city boy

1:35:35
yeah.

1:35:38
That's That's why Mayor wait knew what was gonna happen.

1:35:45
The law changed after when Del Rio has got shot in Charlestown on the field.

1:35:49
Yeah. Shooting some pigeons. Yeah, no, no, no. Yeah. See, we're scaring the heck out of Mary and Tony, because

1:36:02
a different era. Yeah.

1:36:03
Oh, yeah. Boston came along way. Yes.

1:36:10
But But, yeah, as she mentioned, you know, the

1:36:14
difference between Boston, grab whatever on

1:36:17
every trip I ever made.

1:36:24
About the community in those regions are really not visible. You know, my mother lives in Roxbury, she doesn't see the street. And I have to find out what's going on once we don't justify the payment by going because they dig to bail us my mother. But I never get I get I get a summary for the image.

1:36:43
Right. It's intentional. They know exactly as years ago, I used to be involved. That's why I know so much. And I've been in the room when those decisions are being made. And not here. This is when I lived in St. Paul. And, and it used to amaze me. I'm like, but aren't you supposed to have a community hearing? And they're like, oh, yeah, we are gonna have one. But we want to have this plan. We want to do this. I'm like, what did they say? No. And they're like, Oh, well, we're not expecting that because we're going to do dot, dot, dot dot. And then they brought up these meetings, and they deliberately wouldn't invite a lot of the people that so that that's why I know they have how they have to post it where they have to post it when they have to post it and that's also the reason why a lot of these meetings now shifting down to City Hall, okay? Because they know either are at work, or gotta be home when babies get home.

1:37:43
So they can't go parking and stuff like that or whatever.

1:37:48
Which Thank you for saying that. I wanted to ask when you mentioned earlier time pivoting back to what we were talking about different sites. Yeah. How important is parking? Because for me parking is important. Yes.

1:38:02
Well, most of the places that we said have parking like the library reads If we go to the park or whatever

1:38:09
it is but the library and Ed Wilson square doesn't really

1:38:15
have a park Okay, well not really existent. I was saying Dudley here even though I'm Mattapan library around okay, you know, or if it's a clinic or whatever or something, you know, wherever there's a space that we can go I don't know somebody mentioned

1:38:36
I'm okay if you think about this Demyx parking

1:38:41
lot. Go Yeah, no.

1:38:44
Harvard street doesn't have a party and no, I'm thinking I'm walking down walking down Blue Hill I believe it or not, Matt

1:38:52
Penn has a parking lot. Yep. popula an ST. Marcus report. community.

1:38:59
You know, this square has a parking lot. It has a little tiny square

1:39:16
even to in common square, you can even park down there at the Walgreens pocket or whatever. Ooh.

1:39:24
So when the Walgreens used to be in Dudley because I those who don't know I used to work in central Boston. And I used to tell people do not park in that Walgreens parking lot. Have you ever noticed back when it was Walgreens? That there was a tow truck sitting in

1:39:39
there? Oh, yeah. Yeah, but that but they don't didn't have that with just people parked there for the Walgreens and for the across the street. There's no sign that says you know, Walgreens or whatever it is.

1:39:54
footlocker, yes. That was turning those shirts. He would just tell AXA One day watching him. He would just cut. A lady just came in, just parked the car when walking. He grabbed her car. Okay, it was for money. See

1:40:10
now let me say. And she was way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way way. And this is just something again, I know from my past, they can't tow your car until they call the police they call the emergency tow line at the Boston Police Department. And they have to make sure your car is not stolen. So so but But what some of them were doing was they would snatch the car, take it around the corner. Yeah. And then call it in to see if it was stolen. Walgreens had a standing contract with that tow company. Yeah. And that's why that truck was sitting there. Yeah. But see if he if she went into Walgreens, then that would that was that that was a that was she when she came out and her car's gone. And she got her receipt. Oh, yeah, that's

1:41:02
bringing that car but and was that it was illegal. I was watching. I was sitting here watching him. But I was

1:41:10
when I would host programs and stuff just like when I did do things the bone building. People I'm inviting for Saturday's fair. I'm like do not park whether it's open or not. They've got a 24 hour contract with

1:41:26
a token. Yeah. And it's got a

1:41:28
handicap placard you can't pass and you still

1:41:29
can't park it. Okay. No. Because it's because of his reason why? Because I have this property. And private property just like residential. Right permits. Void handicap Plex.

1:41:43
Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Residential. Because you can Yeah, you can still get a ticket. You will get a ticket. Oh, yeah. People think

1:41:54
we pack in a big players parking lot. Yeah. So I was gonna have a picture of blades yesterday. It was funny that old black and white one because all doors down. Bells roll bells. No, no, no.

1:42:16
I hated Robell zazz Bradley's

1:42:20
here's my little bell. Because I grew up in Orchard Park. Oh, was the only store that sold needles for sewing machine. My mom used to send us over there to go get the needle. And the thing I hated about Roe Bell's was you could walk in the store with $100 bill in your hand. And they would call you that was because they were black. And I went there and I'm like 10 years old, got my money in my hand and I got the needles that I'm supposed to get. And I'm walking around and looking for the needles and I remember the guy walking just as close as I am to tell him Yeah, I would stop he would stop and then finally I took what I did was get locked home and said Mom, don't ever send me to that story. Because they treat me like I'm a steals and for that day I never walked in them.

1:43:10
Oh yeah, but it'd be a lot of new folks and more Tupac used to get them now. People used to talk about their story how are they going to change it within a project you could forget that. I've heard stories honey. Oh you days to get them

1:43:26
the this this driver 60 I remember because we went live in 60 house down how's the second floor we're watching the watching the parade my mother comes in the room because we got the windows open comes in loses their mind

1:44:06
at the polls

1:44:10
on the roof, throwing milk bottles down at the cops banging on our door and my old man opens up the door they're like we need your milk deposit

1:44:29
back then needs to deliver the milk and stuff like

1:44:32
that. The glass bottle glass bottle but another watching Fox story. It Miss Mary had a bag this big street from Harris grocery store and you did not help her carry that bag home go home because by the time he got home, everybody on that street would have called your house. Surely I thought you raised that boy do you rather than

1:45:01
speak with the little pack of gum and even though

1:45:05
I saw him not do bla bla bla, you know, but then you get home and all of a sudden, you know, you got the punishment, you're in trouble but that's what it was like growing up in a neighborhood. Everybody, everybody,

1:45:26
yeah. And that's what I was saying to my 22 year old. She uses this quote, it takes a village to raise. Okay, but she has a one year old in a night. I'm proud to be grandmother, I'm blessed to see my grandchildren. I got a great grandma. Don't get to two months old. I tell my daughter, the 22 You don't just come and say, Mom on that day, mom. Watch my daughter? Because I'm gonna say no. And then she said, What about it takes know that you don't know the meaning of that quote, but use it right. And I told that

1:46:10
to your convenience when they leave me today. You Yeah, it does take a village but you got to let the village know that you need to make the village got all the stuff to do.

1:46:24
I don't know about y'all. But I we haven't been married many days, outside and back. And then said I'm gonna call you

1:46:35
no fear, no knees, shoulders. And everybody's I don't put my hand off. You're my child. Because you've got younger people having children. So they ignorant as hell. So then they raise these kids. Don't be good. I don't care. You could call my mom and she ain't gonna you know, these kids are just like

1:46:57
that. But you know, and the sad thing about it is is think about it. It what freaks me out all the time is when my dad comes out of my Oh, yeah. My parents my dad, I still remember the time and that's when my son was five years old and and my dad came out of my mouth with boy turn that crap that

1:47:18
is that stuff like

1:47:20
oh my god, same old when I told my daughter, don't wait, you can't always do what you want to do. Or whatever I looked at my mother was like

1:47:34
the first time I had to spank my child. Yes. I expect my child. Hey, we all know. I called my mom is something you wouldn't call my mom and apologize.

1:47:44
I'm sorry.

1:47:48
Because now I understood the phrase. Yeah, he's gonna hurt me

1:47:51
more than once.

1:47:54
Because I'm sorry that you are doing something that you know no better than what? And I have to punish you. Yeah, you know, but I will. I didn't see it like that. It's like I told you what to do and what not to do. And so when you made that choice to go against what I said, there's consequences, because I'm not abusing you. I'm disciplining discipline, because I'm bringing you now so the cops don't kill you later.

1:48:17
They will understand though, as I've gotten older that there are some parents slash adults who don't don't have that switch in their head right says, Let me not grab this whatever. Exactly the hell out of my because yeah, there's a fine line between abuse and discipline. This is Oh, yeah. And some people don't know that. Right. Yeah. You know, when you see these babies, and this this what breaks my heart when I say?

1:48:46
Yes, exactly. Yes. See, that's abuse. That's, that's abuse. So what you have to do the poor babies dying from Shaken Baby Syndrome. And that's all kinds of stuff because these young parents take the baby crying, shouting, you know, I'm saying this is like, the baby's crying for a reason something is wrong with the babies

1:49:06
but not defending it. But again, back in our youth, there were other people who were able to help out.

1:49:15
Yeah, yeah, that that's that village? Yes, exactly. My daughter, she's satisfied. You're framing him. And she says, the baby don't sleep that night. So I'm saying, Okay, did you check her? She's at my checkup and I had to tell him, I said, Well, it might be that pop me in. It might be that part of me. Safer scoops. I gave us some scripts. Songs. Okay, when she could pray over her night. You I asked her Did you know the history of where you're at? She said she said no. I said because children say Want to see? Goals?

1:50:03
No, not even that children can feel they can feel vibes. And if this baby's used to be and just say at your house, then you have different she goes, yeah should take a different, you know, acting or whatever the baby's not used to that whatever, not just that boy did she feed in her before it's time to go to bed or whatever all those things play. And sometimes these young kids just don't know how to rely on this, because that's the only one that has kids. My daughter had her oldest child. And she was young. Okay, so she ain't know how to obliterate time, but she used to cry because she's like, I want to be able to be able to soothe my own baby and be whatever, I guess I'd be out in the bar because I don't handle babies. She used to call me up on the phone. And I hit a baby crying in the background. And she do that on purpose that you know, I'm gonna be like, What's the matter, whatever, what's what's going on? Whenever I give you the musi whenever she knew I'll be coming. I'd be out like at the club, whatever. I'd be like, watch my drink, whatever, whatever, whatever. I'll be right back. I go home, get that baby put that baby to sleep or whatever's in later. You know, I'm saying she's like you. I said yeah. Because they don't know because you have a child yourself. I mean, even though that cemetery, whatever. Yeah, but she still graduated with honors National Honor Society. All that stuff with our class still was still she was a child. You know what I'm saying? So she didn't really have the she used to be chronometer. Why are you crying? She said, Because I want to be able to this is my baby. I'm supposed to be able to Well, you better learn. I said, because I'm not gonna be coming home every single time. You know, you can't get your baby to sleep. I'm telling you that my

1:51:44
girls, it was awful. My girls got children. But it's this young wife was born in 2000s. This one that child? She doesn't listen, when I'm trying to tell her about her baby. My other girls. They I showed them and they listen, they listen. And they.

1:52:03
But then so they should be the ones telling her.

1:52:08
He tried to I tried. They do they do try to tell her. But she doesn't.

1:52:15
But I will tell you, you know, here's a positive Grandpa Grandpa story. My son who lives in Florida, in his family calls me up. Whenever he finds himself having an interaction with his son, my grandson, like he would handle was 10. Yeah, like we did. And the first time I saw this app and play out in real time, I was down being grandpa down visiting. And we're watching something on TV. And those two got into a debate about where the Golden Gate Bridge was located. Yeah, but my grandma, my son is Mike. My grandson is Michael. But they're they're going back and forth. And because Michael is convinced the Golden Gate Bridge is located in New York because he's confusing it with the Washington Bridge. Oh. She's been over. Yes, yes, yes. Exactly. Meanwhile, I'm sitting there watching this. I love it.

1:53:23
You tried to tell these kids,

1:53:25

1:53:36
My God. Yesterday, she tried to tell my 22 year old you know, your mom's house. You have to respect her. You can't just talk to any any form you want. Okay? And she said, she told her once you move out, get your own place to do it. She said You and Mom will have a better relationship. And she said I was at the mouth. Okay, I thought that the mafia mindset. You want to be grown? Go on grow.

1:54:15
Lakes, how about? So you

1:54:19
tell them my 22 year old? She said, Well, you was only in the shelter for six weeks. I said that bad thing. They have a bunch of help. They had a bunch out. I did my work. That's how I got my sectioning. You can go into the shelter now talking my sternum. And it'd be 10 years before you could get

1:54:41
to the people that's trying to help it

1:54:43
That's what she said. She didn't want to do chores. I said you have to do chores. Maybe I wasn't hard enough to make you do chores. That's why you think you don't.

1:54:55
But once you get your own place, you got to do chores today. Nobody else coming in here to clean data I'm gonna have a mate. Yeah, you gotta learn how to do some chores. myself

1:55:05
no chores that we don't call. We didn't even call them chores. It was just your job.

1:55:10
Yeah. And see, and I was spoiled because I was only child. I didn't. I really didn't have two kids. It just me and my mother. You know what it was, I didn't ever Washington, we always had a washing machine. So I didn't even want to stop watching my old clothes. And I was like in high school. In high school, when I first started putting stuff into watch,

1:55:30
I remember this is how I this is how I learned how to wash clothes. The night before, or the night before they took me to the airport to put me on a plane to go to college. My mom took me down in the basement said I need to show you how to wash clothes because you might not find somebody to do it for now here's what she did tell me to separate? No no no. She taught me how that one of the things she taught me separate your dark a white but she didn't tell me what how much bleach is the most? Oh, my mom god. Yeah. So whatever we because I'm late. I'm doing my whites on campus. I put my whites in there. I'm thinking I'm all of that took my bleach. But Jesus, mind you all I had was maybe a few T shirts and socks. Like I had a whole load

1:56:24
because she was washing for the family. Not just Yeah, I learned how to cook or not watch.

1:56:34
A watch called Zach's seven. Because my grandmother had 14 kids. My grandmother had 14 kids. And my grandmother raised me my brother, my sister because our mom died. My mom died at 20 years old breast cancer. And my grandmother took us and so we then Tada I went to have a sweet I learned Thai mom. I learned how to wash dishes watch code. I mean did everything every My grandmother had a schedule for all kids that we have certainly do every day. We do our homework, we have a snack. If we if we got chores we do chose to go home. Right? Right, you know, yeah. See, I didn't do all you do. The only child I didn't know I didn't really. I didn't make my kids really clean because I cleaned and I regretted the only thing I was the only thing I made sure they did was go to school and get your high school diploma college might not be for everybody. But you got to get in that's what my grandma was stalling. She didn't stop calling. Want to go, you know, see what they see my son sorry, my son. He's only boy, he got into some trouble. So he had too little time. So I said to him, Well, since you got time learning he can do

1:58:11
a college degree too. And he's

1:58:15
he got it. And all of that, due to the court system they paid for. Once he got home. He they paid for him to go back to college to take the GED. He passed it like that, because he messed up in 12th grade goes

1:58:34
getting a GED is harder than getting into

1:58:40
doing everything all at once you know? But it's somebody that's

1:58:50
one taken if you concentrate on school and ascending champions do you want to have it but

1:58:59
you but you know something though, I was the first person in my in my family. I'm a first time first generation college college grad. My grandmother was a licensed beauty. She's always telling me my grandmother was the first black licensed beautician to work for the state of mass mass mental hospital. I was the first one ever go to college, which mean they got I had teachers and guidance counselors who who helped me because my family I mean, my own man had his own little tiny own rehab, which we had to work with once we were old enough to pick up crap, which I hated doing that. So we was kind of spoiled because we had to work but as far as all of the other stuff we didn't have to do yeah so when I got that admission let us and I was going to college the first time and I see you I went to the job site that day. And these all the all these men watched me grow up. I went I'm like I'm officially informing you I quit. I will never be doing this and yeah is out of the comedy. And it was. And then they used to call me college boy, whenever I would come home was like, Oh, this is college what? When years later, you know, my dad has passed away and stuff like that. And I got an award thing and I'm in the car. Now you got to remember when I was growing up and we would ride around my dad was like, That's my porch. That's my chimney. That's my roof, you know, houses that he had worked on. And we would be riding around. And and I always wondered, because I got to college and became a social worker. I mean, I was a paper pusher. Yeah. And I always wondered, was he disappointed in me? Because I never built anything. Oh, wow. Something that I could say? Yes. Right. No, no to ask you. To tell you that. So my dad died of a brain tumor. Ironically, I just moved back here. Yeah. When it was his last summer. And his his, his, his manager was not really running the company yet. But they had this routine that I grew up, which is all the guys would come over because they had depending on two or three bands. And they all come over to the house. And they gather outside and they go through the who's going where and who's gonna fix what, right, right. And he'd say, Okay, you monkeys, I'm gonna be coming by to check on all of you to make sure I don't screw up. And then they don't they get the car they leave. That was their routine, right? And I come home for I come home. And he is no longer able to do that. But they would still all come over the house. And before they got there, my mom would take him out front. Cinnamon is shared with a cup of coffee, then they'd all roll in. And the manager would do. And then he would say, Okay, you monkeys don't screw up our normal come out check on Yeah. And then they all pull away so that him and I are sitting on the front porch. And my my father was a typical southern black man. And I say that because where I'm going with this. So he turns to me, and he says, because because my son was still who was three times that Minnesota was his mom, I moved back here. And he's like, so you're talking to boy often. Now keep in mind my son has named but he called him the boy and talk to the boy off. And I'm like, Yeah, we talk every day. He calls me at night to tell me what's going he goes, Oh, okay. Do you tell him you love him? Now I'm not gonna lie. We're sitting on that porch. And all of a sudden, I'm like, what hell's this conversation going? Because I didn't think this man could spell the word. And I'm like, Yeah, I tell him. I love him all the time. You're telling me proud of him? I'm like, yeah, he knows I'm proud of them. Because Bobby goes good, because you know, they need to hear that.

2:02:41
Yeah. Never

2:02:43
said that to you. Not ever. Okay. And

2:02:46
he came into my life when I was roughly about seven years old. Oh, my biological but he was. So I'm sitting there. And we're sitting there like, and then he goes, What about the Red Sox? You think they're gonna find a new way? And he saved me because now we're back in our comfort zone. Right, right. And he passed away roughly less than a week later. So I've got this award that I got from the city. I'm in the car. And the first person I call was my mom to tell her about it. And I wish I could have invited her but I didn't know. And I asked her. Do you think he'd be proud of me? that's out there. What I got was and I'm bragging now, the city of Boston named the day after?

2:03:32
And what day is it? March 13. Oh.

2:03:37
Here I've had this thing. That's pretty cool. Yeah, my first thought would, would my dad finally be proud? No, no. And he been passed away for 20 something years. And my mom laughed. And I've shared this with my son. I mean, my kids, I said, you know, she said, all he ever wanted was you guys to be better. And I pulled over the side of the road and just ball.

2:04:03
Do you hear that? Yeah. And he was telling you could sound it was kind of annoying. Yeah, the words and my daughter says I say to my grandkids, I love you. I love you and my daughter. Come on, I'll say, You never said that to me. Yeah. You're right. I didn't because it wasn't ever said to me. So I think you I told that as being a grandparent. You making that for what you did.

2:04:38
Sometimes we're better grandparents than we were a pair. Yeah. And sometimes because of certain things or whatever. Because even with me with my kids, because I was ripping him running down and doing whatever whatever whatever. And so some things I you know, but I still always provided all the very thing and whatever, but sometimes they need that. I love us. I probably owe them hugs and whatever. a monogram babies. That's why, you know, whatever so that's because yeah, oh yeah. But not even just that I just always loved to you know what I'm saying even with them and not to sound like sometimes your kids tell you stuff and you're like what? Like you know sometimes they are but they remember certain things because they remember how they are how they whatever, and you're like, Ah, no, that's the end like, I did this and this and this and that, but I haven't never been

One year and three months, one year. And fun fact about me, I just love everybody, regardless of how they should be. Because you have to, you have to love, because Jesus and God love, love everybody. Thank

00:20
you all for listening.

00:26
Why don't we go this way?

00:27
Timothy S: How about that? How about that? Hi, I'm Timmy. I'm from Dorchester, name area,

00:37
Timothy S: and act about yourself. The

00:40
Timothy S: fun fact is, I have grandkids, five of them from 17 to two, and they are killing me. That's the fun fact. I'm enjoying it, but they're killing me another

01:02
Mike K: I'm Mike. I'm living from Roxbury. I'm gonna piggyback on Timmy. Fun fact about me is watching my two grandsons drive my son crazy with the same things that He drove me crazy with.
Mary N: I am Mary. I don’t have any children or grandchildren. I am the child in this senerio.

01:36
Mary: fun fact is that I speak three languages,

01:50
three, which are those.

01:52
Mary: So I speak my native languages, which are two, Kirundi and Kinyarwanda. So I'm from Burundi, which is Kirundi and in Rwanda they speak kinyarwanda. Never mind It's four, I speak Swahili which is like a language that people in East Africa speak, which is where my country is, regionally wise, and I'm obviously English.

02:18
Bonnie: I'm Bonnie, and I'm from way up, and my fun fact is that Mike says, Hey, Tony's giving a talk. You want to go? He's starting lunch. Okay? Where are we going?

02:35
Nadine: admits it, okay. My name is Nadine, and I'm from Boston, and my fun fact is, we just got through talking about my 26 grandkids I have, from ages eight to almost 34 and they're not driving me crazy, but they're insisting that I continue to stay alive. And I'm like, Oh, y'all gotta make me be alive forever. But I guess it's okay. So you know, if I can get rid of some of this pain, though, I'd be better able to live the life that they want me to live. Okay, I'd be like, grandma's struggling with this one. So that's why you hear, right? Yeah, exactly.

Tony Pham  03:25
And as you all know, I'm Tony, Tony Pham. I'm a psychiatrist and Mass General. I work with Mr. Kincaid and Mary and Yeah, happy, so thankful that y'all are here virtually and in person. There's a number of things that I was hoping we could talk about. Chronic Pain is gonna be one of them. But actually, just started off, I was hoping if we could talk about questions about memory. You know, I know that as we get older, I know Mr. Kincaid is very well experienced in this. We basically have a lot of,

04:02
Tony P: sorry, a lot of changes in our in our development, some of which is like, you know, pain, but some of which is like, it's harder to remember stuff, it's harder to concentrate, and it's hard because there's sort of like a spectrum where it's like, you start to have it, and you you wonder sometimes, like, oh, do I have x diagnosis? Whether it's like dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and so forth. But what's really important is prevention and kind of tackling those concerns before it begins to become that. And I think we're all here because, essentially, we don't have a diagnosis of like dementia, but we do have concerns about our memory, and things related to our memory in such a way that it might even get in the way of our lives, you know, in terms of being able to

Tony Pham  04:53
just remember things like we used to, and it might frustrate us. And so I was wondering if folks here, would you  be interested in talking about their experiences, please. Oh, just turns itself off. Oh, I was like, Who was that?

05:10
Yeah, exactly, that's the person who needs the psychiatrist.

05:15
She needs a robot.

05:20
Tony: Yeah, I was wondering if folks here would be able to kind of talk about their experiences or other people's experiences when it comes to, yeah, just memory, concentration, or any like concern about having dementia.

05:38
Timothy: I can tell you that, since I was young,

05:41
Tony: I'm sorry. Can I Can I interrupt one second? Let's see.

05:49
Tony: Hi. Can you hear us? Okay, not bad. I think. Let me see, it's a little hard to hear you. On. All right, I think we should be good now. Can you say something again?

Tony Pham  06:09
Yeah, all right, could you just introduce yourself? We just introduced ourselves. But could you say your name, where you're from, and a fun fact about yourself?

Talia Jones: My name is Talia Jones, I am from Somerville. I love (unknown)

Tony Pham  06:27
right, well, well, you'll start to hear us, because before we talk, I'm just going to ask everyone to say their names, and honestly, if it's okay with y'all, I know we started a bit late, so if we could go to like 230 that I think that would give us more time to talk, but if you all have to go at two, because that was the original time, no worries on our end. But yeah, I was just talking about how, you know, as we get older, sometimes memory issues come up, or issues related to memory. And was just wondering if folks here could talk a little bit about their experiences having concerns about that, or even other people they know who have had concerns about memory, oh yeah, oh yeah, please.

07:12
Timothy: I was gonna say that when I was young, that I did not have a good memory. And what that made me do was like, like, let's say educational. I had to learn the lessons that would allow me to figure out the problems, rather than memorize certain things, because I just couldn't do it. And it carried on throughout my life. You know, I have a very terrible memory, you know what I mean? So I need to know how to do things, or know how things work in order to get it done.

07:47
Tony: I see, yeah, so it sounds like because you know how you operate, you know, you've been able to kind of tackle that issue beforehand.

07:55
Timothy: And I think it may be a crutch too. Now I don't have to memorize nothing. I may have used it as a crutch,

08:03
Tony: what are some of those things that that work for you?

08:07
Timothy: Well, like I said, for the most part, it's knowing how things work, like how to figure things out, like if there's a problem, knowing the process from you know, start to finish. So therefore, no matter what the issue is, I know how to work the progress or process. Yeah, you know what I mean,

Tony: I love that.

08:30
Timothy: It's just time consuming. But you know, that's what's bailed me out, like I don't even if you were to ask me anybody, anybody in my family's phone number, I'd say I don't know. I'd have to look into both.

(unknown): I can raise my hand,

08:46
especially since you got this

Tony: before y'all talk, could you just say your name? Because we got the microphone

08:51
Nadine: Yeah, I can relate to that, because I don't know anybody's phone number. I might have two people that I know their phone number if they don't answer. If my phone dies, if my phone crash, I'm just out of luck. And one time, they laughed at me. The children laughed at me because I went and I got a phone book, and I started passing out phone books, right? And they and they laughed at me because I'm like, Well, what happens if you lose all of this and you're so used to just hitting a button and there is no button to hit, you know? So they can laugh at me all they want to. I get a pencil and a piece of paper and I write it down. So, okay, so you know,
Mike: I'm Mike Kincaid

09:43
Mike: and and this is something that those of you who know me, you've seen something interesting happen just today, just now, which is I remember timmy's name. And the only reason why I remember timmy's name was because my late young brother's nickname was Timmy.

09:59
Nadine: But you didn't remember your own.

10:03
Mike: Im going with this, and you've seen this. You've seen me say this when I'm talking with groups. Do I not always say when we meet again? Remind me of your name. Remind me where we met in your name, because I'm not going to remember. And the interesting phenomenon is my head is full of useless, trivial information. Yeah, I mean, and I'm not joking, we'll hear a song, and Bonnie will say, who said that? Who sang that song? And I will tell her, and she'll say, what did the album cover look like? And I could literally pull it up and describe it, because I've got that kind of memory, yeah? But ask me the name of the person that I met two hours ago, right? And I'm like, red shirt because it's, it's now. Does that worry me? No, always been like that, yeah, my child,

10:57
Nadine: your long term is better than your short term. Just doesn't compute.

11:04
Mike: Well, according to, you know,my mom and them, it's because I'm not paying attention, right? Introduce yourself to me. I'm not paying right, okay? But the reality is, is that so much happens between the time I met you and next 10 minutes that it's, it's, I lose it in there,

11:22
Bonnie: but that doesn't make sense. I'm sorry. This is Bonnie. This is Rob, because you can remember stuff, album covers, but you can't remember details from two hours ago. What sense does that make?

11:37
Mike: And the only answer I can give is, I really like that music 20 years ago,

11:46
Mike: but, but as somebody who has Alzheimer's in his family, I mean at least two, at least two generations, probably longer, but we noticed it to grandmother and mother that it's and As someone who works in this business, it's easy for me to recognize it, probably in a million other people, but it's up to her. It's up to Bonnie to recognize it in me, because my kids have an excuse if I don't remember names because they grew up knowing, well, that number was really good remembering people's names. And that's, that's, I think, part of the thing is, people have excuses to for. What a problem, I think.

12:33
Timothy: But the question is, is that something too worry about, because you don't remember names? I don't. I'm not.

12:39
Tony: Yeah, I'm going to get back to that, but before I do, I want to make a note of it. I just want to say hi to the Zoom world. Is anyone out there? Also want to talk about, say like their experiences, or share like concerns they've had about memory related issues, hopefully our microphones on

13:02
Tony:, hi, hopefully they didn't step away for too long. Is anyone out there? All right, we'll wait for them. Oh, hi, okay, just wanted to make sure. Can you hear us? Okay,

(unknown): Yes, I’m here

Tony: Can you hear us ok?

13:18
Anne: fine, okay, I was waiting for someone else to see they wanted to go. Some days, right? So myself, like say, if I put something down, or remember, sometimes just don't remember where I put it. It's like, a few minutes have passed. It's like, wait a minute or I put something up, like in my closet somewhere. We call when to, like, days later, and that's like a concern. That's a concern to me, but like on Sundays, after church, I go and visit a sweet little lady. She's 83 years old. She has dementia.

14:07
Anne: She remembers me,

14:08
Anne: she knows my name and everything, but it's kind of sad because she talks about her mother, you know, like she's still living. I just sit there and listen, you know, let her, let her talk. And then she she love to listen to gospel music, so I put on the TV with video. I call her Ma. Said, Come on, Ma, let's let's sing along, let's sing. She be singing me, I take new videos of her, and sometimes I take her and I take a selfie, and I posted on Facebook, and she loved that. So I tried to go back when I come in town every Sunday after church, and then I get there around 2:30 and then I leave. When I leave this Sunday, I left like eight. So thank you all for listening.

15:10
Tony: Yeah, no. Thank you for sharing that.

15:14
Mike: Gonna jump in. Anne right?. What you're doing is amazing, and God bless you for doing it. Let me make a couple of suggestions. When you go over to see her, remind her who you are. Okay, just, just cure. And also with with the music and stuff. Music is an emotional memory, an emotional memory. Stay with us forever. You know you smell something, you taste something, you hear something, it'll take you back to the first time you remember that, so that you're doing a lot of great things. And as far as you forgetting where you put stuff, what's happening with that? And most of it happened to me all the time. I get up to go get something to eat, get in the kitchen and can't remember what I was there for. That's normal, because between the time you put it away and the time you go to look for it, you got distracted by something and you and the funny thing is, is we never remember the distraction. It could be an ambulance gone by with the siren. You never remember distraction. But that's what causes you to say, wait a minute, what did I come in here for? The easy answer, as I put it, to reboot your brain, is go back to doing what you were doing before it'll come back to you. Yeah, it will come back., eventually it'll come back to

16:51
Nadine: Sometimes, Sometimes. I lost the earrings last year in July, and I think I found them a month ago, I was really going out my door with these earrings. I packed up my stuff. I was going out the door, and when I got where I was going, I didn't have my earrings. Didn't know where my earrings were, and I really, actually thought maybe I tossed them in the trash Okay, on my way out the door, because I did not find these earrings, and one day, about a month ago, out the clear blue sky, okay? And I'm like, I would never even look for my earrings where I found them at, okay? And I don't even know how they got in that room where they was at, because I, like I said, was on my way from the back of the house to the front of the house and out the door, yeah, and that's how long it took me that I didn't know where those earrings were, that I began to think I tossed them in the trash. That's the only, you know, that's the only thing that made sense.

18:10
Tony: Did you feel like, frustrated or angry? Yeah,

18:13
Nadine: because those was my earrings, and they was my good earrings and my nice earrings, and I'm like, I can't believe I

18:21
Mike: So, yeah, and you got them back.

18:23
Nadine: I sure do,

18:24
Tony: did it start to make you think, like, you know, do I have something? Is something wrong with me? Um, it's okay if not,. I'm just curious.

18:32
Nadine: You were saying you had two generations of folks that had it, right? I had it with my my mom, my grandmother, my grandmother's sisters, and I think I've asked you this question before, if this is like

18:51
Nadine: hereditary, if

18:53
Nadine: it's hereditary for one but if it's something that more so affects women than men, like genealogy wise, because none of the men in our family have this. It's only women.

19:06
Mike: So not to, not to get off course. But that's a trick question, okay, and then I'm going to just put this right on the table. Part of the problem, yes, statistically, black women will get some form of dementia more than black men. The other statistic, which is why, when you said the men in your family, we as black men, if we make it to 70, that's considered old, which, which is why the disease, if it starts to manifest itself, if you think about it, you start to notice it in the late 60s, which by and it's funny, we're talking about chronic pain. Yeah, you know, for a lot of black men, you know, I mean, I'm about to turn 66 years old, my older brother and I have outlived all the black men in our family, and so we're charting new territory. But where I'm going with this is, if a black man. In is going to get some type of dementia in those years where you start to notice it, late 60s, early 70s. They're also dealing with a ton of other medical issues, so that memory loss part gets lost with the hypertension, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart disease, all those other things that take us out.


20:28
 Mike: so the easy answer is, the reason why? I mean, there's a whole bunch of other reasons, but part of the reason is, is that you ladies live longer than us, which I'm going to do a shameless plug, because this is my new soap box. The thing I'm talking about we as black men need to learn more about this disease, because the reality is that if our women are going to get this, and I'm be honest about it, it's usually the woman that

20:56
Mike:  controls the household, right?

20:57
Mike: That if our women are going to get this, we need to know how to care for them, because when they when they start to show signs, all right, that's my little pitch for

21:08
Tony:I want to actually return to that, but just for a moment. Miss Cynthia, can you hear us?

21:14
Tony: I know you're driving, but you don't have to turn on the microphone right now, but just wanted to give you a moment if you do have one say your name, where you're calling from, or where you're from, and a fun fact about yourself

21:27
Cynthia: . I can do that right now. Okay, hey everybody. I'm Cynthia from Roxbury. A fun fact about myself. Fun

21:41
Cynthia: fact. Fun fact. I

21:42
Cynthia: just turned 59 Oh,

Tony Pham  21:47
congratulations. Happy late birthday. Yeah, so we're just talking about memory, as you can tell, like talking about memory, concerns about memory as you get older, and that kind of in between stage where we're starting to notice changes, but we don't quite meet qualifications for specific dementia diagnosis. But Mr. Kincade was bringing up something that was really interesting, which is this difference, you know, when it comes to not only, you say, like, memory related issues between, say, white and black populations, but black men and black women. And I'm curious from y'all if there are other folks who have noticed differences in how, say, black women versus black men express themselves when it comes to, you know, memory asking help for memory related problems, or even seeking care for memory related problems. And you know, I've definitely heard about some of this with other groups we've run. But I'm curious, before I bring those, those facts up, what y'all have experienced, or what are seen.

22:59
Cynthia: Well, while my mic is open, if it's okay, if I just jump in and then I can shut it off for a little bit. But I would say this, I am always processing. We women communicate a lot, and I think that we make a lot of things normal, which may not be normal. So the normalizing, because we're all dealing with some level of it, or suffering from it. When someone says it, you know, we're more like, oh, girl, you are right. We all dealing with that, and it can really be a problem. But because we made it so normal, it gets put aside. So if someone's dealing with it more than maybe the average person. We've already shrugged it off of it's a normal event in our lives as women.

23:50
Tony: I see, anyone else out there, either in zoom or here, have thoughts about, you know, differences when it comes to gender.

23:57
Timothy: I know. I know. I'm cognizant of the fact that all the women in my family are alive. The men are not. My grandmother's like, turning 94 I think a couple days, my mother's turning 80. But the men of that generation are gone, yeah, you know what I mean. So I'm very aware that yeah, and, you know, just keep in mind, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's just something I've all been conscious of, yeah, like you say past earlier,

24:48
Nadine: as long as you make it past that door today.

24:53
Tony: Something I've heard before is this idea where, you know, say you're in a partnership with someone, your wife or your husband. I've heard. That sometimes from black women, there's this feeling like, you know, because their partner may pass sooner and if memory concerns come up in their partner, that they almost have to do double duty, whether it's taking care of their memory issues, but also taking care of their partner. And I'm curious if y'all are seen that or heard about that, and what the impact that might have.

25:22
Mike: It's years ago. I ran a support group here in Roxbury.

25:24
Tony: I didn't know

25:27
Mike: of partners, the husbands and wives. I had three guys, it was all black group, and I had a couple of the women in my group who we were concerned about their memory, who were adamant that they had to take care of their husbands, who had been diagnosed with dementia. And then one of them, I remember to this day, she needed an aide, but she put so many hurdles in front to keep it from happening. It had to be a man. It had to be a man who was a Mason. It had to be a man. He had to be black, because these are all the things that her husband so she she said, it's got to be somebody that he can relate to. And I to his day, in mind somebody up above was looking down on us, because we found somebody that checked every one of those boxes except he was too young. That was the only thing, but we were able to convince her that she needed that help, because she was determined it was her job to care for her husband, even if it killed her.

26:33
Tony: wow, that’s powerful.

26:35
Mike: that’s not unusual.

26:37
Mary: do you also feel that another reason why, I guess black women, or women in general, tend to live longer than men, is that sense of like mistress that happens with women, in the sense that I realized that when I look at my friends, right, my girlfriends, I pretend to be very close, so I tend to like, almost share about everything. And even if there's an issue you're still talking about it, and you're having someone to relate to and to support you. Whereas when I look at men and my uncles and like people in that generation, particularly, like in like the 50s and 60s, that's not the case. And you feel like that also, like impacts people's health, like in your opinion, from your experiences.

27:21
Mike: I just want a clarification. Is it just Tony, Timmy and I are the only guys.

27:27
Tony: We almost had, Mr. Derek K but he had to step out.

27:38
Tony: I mean, almost like what you were mentioning, or like maybe you'll even alluding to, is from a numbers perspective. You know, it's hard to see as much men, you know, come out to certain things like community spaces, UCB and you know, when you think about brotherhood versus sisterhood, I imagine there's still brotherhood in black communities, but maybe it's different than sisterhood, but I don't know, right?

28:03
Timothy: I think they're developing now more, more brotherhoods are developing. Now more I see, you know, like a new generation, it's like a generational shift, because I'm not particularly comfortable, given my background, I'm not comfortable just spending all day with men, and I've spent enough years with men. I'm good. I, but, yeah, but I don't know if it impacts the mental health. You know, I don't, I don't know if that's so much impactful of the mental health because, I mean, I don't know how much talking about it helps it, you know what I'm saying, or mental health, but just health in general, I don't know how much talking about it helps it.

28:52
Mike: You know, it's funny, you ask that question. And I'm sitting there thinking, and my oldest, closest friends, except for one, are women. I mean, I've got one male friend from high school, yeah. But other than that, I mean, you know, and do we keep in touch all the time? No, people who are my friends know, I'm not that guy that's calling you every Sunday to know how it is going, yeah. That's just not who I am, you know. But the other, you know, the other thing, the underlining, unspoken elephant in the room here is, and I'm gonna use just myself as an example. I do not express my illnesses openly, if, you know I'm putting this on the table, and I've said this publicly before, if Bonnie doesn't notice something's wrong, I'm not going to tell her. And then when she does notice it's wrong, it's haul my butt to, you know, urgent care or, I mean, I work for Mass General Brigham, but you know, I've said this public. I've said it on the air, my whole TV show, this woman basically saved my life because I caught a virus, but I didn't know, and she was the one that dragged me to the hospital and had me, had me go through all of that. And the reality is, is from talking to other men, that is not uncommon. So that may be why you live longer than us because you get tired of dragging up,

30:32
Mike: because she lived through it, and that's why I always give her credit for, yeah, saving your life, saving my life because I'm too stupid to know, you know, part of our problem is and correct me. If I'm wrong, guys, it'll go away. Yeah. I mean, it breaks my heart. I read a story about a man who died in prostate cancer because he didn't bother to get checked. The job was too late when there are symptoms, and we know this, that show up at a very early stage. So,

31:05
Tony: it'll go away is a powerful statement. And, you know, and you know, as I'm listening to y'all, I'm also, you know, as an Asian American, kind of drawing parallels between, like, similar things in in the, say, like Vietnam and differences. And I'm curious if you all have seen comparisons between say, like, you know, how people in the black population may express themselves in relation to like health concerns or memory issues or chronic pain or even seeking care, versus say, like people from white populations. And is there a difference, or do you think it's it's pretty similar, maybe just like the context is different.

31:47
Timothy: I think, I think access to the healthcare and the treatment by the healthcare professionals is different. You know, I had a injury not long ago, and it required, I don't know if it was Percocet or an oxy

32:07
Timothy: one of those pain pill and

32:11
Timothy: I went to the doctor. He told me, come back in a week. You know, I go back in a week. He comes in, and he almost sent me to jail because I was gonna whip his ass, because he's yelling and screaming at me because he thinks I'm there to access more opioids you understand, and I’m like, what the hell are you talking about. I don't need no because I don't want no pill. You know what I mean. And he just was going ballistic because he just automatically assumed I'm coming back for and I never went back to see him, of course, you know, but he came very close to catching a bad one, and me too.

32:50
Nadine: But you know, if your skin was a different color, he would have really not, not even question it. Not even question you wanting it, okay, or if you needed it

33:05
Timonthy: Well, I had the script. I had the script, and I needed no more, right? Was my point, okay? And the only reason I was there was because he asked me to come back, you understand? So if he would have done his, you know, reviewing his notes before sending his people coming to see me. You know, he would have known why I was there, you know, yeah, and, and that's what I think happens all the time, because I spent a lot of time in prison also, and I was very, very, very reluctant of the information I received from the healthcare, and I always was trying to double check because I didn't trust them, you know, and I still don't, you know, yeah, but fortunately, I don't have any health issues, yeah, so you know it's not, it's not an ongoing issue,

33:55
Mike: but so I'm gonna, I'm gonna play devil's advocate here. Okay, it was mentioned lack of access. Now this is before urgent care. You put that on the table. Years ago, I did my own little research. And within the metro, within the Boston area, there were 21 health facilities. There were 22 McDonald's restaurants. I literally looked this up. Now, there's more, not there's less McDonald's restaurant, but because of the explosion of urgent care units in certain neighborhoods, you got gazillion two blocks and you can find a healthcare facility. So so I'm so I'm playing devil's advocate. Why is it that folks will go into a McDonald's and tip over a table because their French fries are too cold. But they won't walk into a mental health facility or a community health center or an urgent care or one of the major hospitals we've got, internationally known hospitals in our backyard. They won't walk through those front doors. Yeah, until they have to or if they do, walk through those front doors and a doctor tells them something that they don't agree with, they just say, okay and walk out like I said. They'll tip over the table for cold fries. But a doctor will say, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Instead of saying tell me what that means. They say, okay and leave, you know, and really they didn't get care. So we got to own a little bit of that. You know, I'm not saying bad service, because God knows, that's a whole different crazy. But the fact is, is that we live in a city that has tons of healthcare facilities that are just begging people to- Community health centers are just looking for people to come, new people to come to their door.

35:50
Timothy: Hey, you can, you can check, you can double check, you can always go to the next one. That's right, you know, and that's right. That's the way. I don't understand why people show for that one. You say that. Yeah. Dismissive service

36:03
Mike: Yeah. Again, we use McDonald's. I go in this McDonald's. They got cold fronts. I ain't going in. I'm going into one up here.

Tony Pham  36:10
And before we go back to communication, I just wanted to give them, I see your hands raised, or two hands are raised, if you all want to speak up over in the Zoom world, jump in on this. Yeah, please. I don't know. It may have been about something before, because I saw your hand for a minute. Yeah, and just say your name before you go, Oh,

36:28
Sandra: I shouldn't have iPhone on you. I should have changed my name. I'm sorry. Guys, my phone,

36:32
it's okay. It's just for the recording. Yeah, hold on, hi. I'm

36:37
Sandra: guys, let me figure out how to change this order. I'm Sandra, and I was just trying to figure out, because I had to put you on mute for a minute because the social worker was here. But I'm just wondering, what was the topic. I remember it

36:56
was talked about memory.

Tony: Oh yeah, we're still in memory.

36:59
Sandra: I went away, so that way you guys were at yep, yep.

Tony Pham  37:03
We’re just talking about our experiences and memory and issues related to that, and now we're actually talking about like communication norms and the differences when it comes to expressing oneself or seeking care. Say as a black person, when you compare to say like someone who's white, and what, why and how and where, and then let's see, I'm just going to call on others miss Cynthia.

37:32
Cynthia: So I wanted to chime in on this, because I'm that person that would go to the doctor for whatever I needed to go to the doctor for before covid. And I've lost so much faith and trust in, you know, just from the clinics to the hospitals, that I really don't go. I really don't go unless I absolutely have to, and it's an emergency and I'm being taken into ambulance like it, that is, you know, it's like the cycles that continue to perpetuate themselves, wherein, yes, this time was covid, but last time, it was something else, and it was something else that actually caused people to continuously lose trust and faith in the systems that are supposed to be there to help us, right? And so now, as we go forward, is covid now, but what will it be in 5, 10, years when you're finally trying to get you know you're building up faith again in the systems, just to find yourself right back again with mistrust because of and it's not so much what I seen happen with other people. It was what I personally experienced just was It was horrible for you to entrust your life to others, and you didn't get the care back of someone caring about you. So with the memory stuff and all that, I don't even go and talk to them about it, because the only thing that they do is they want to point to medication. Everything's about you need medication. Oh, you got this now, why don't we try this medication on you, and everything is a trial. It's a trial and a trial and a trial. And then you become the, you know, the

39:31
Tony: like a guinea pig, guinea pig,

39:34
Cynthia: but the experiment is constantly being done. You all know that the medication almost killed you off that one, put you on another one. It's just, it's such a cycle, and I just feel like it's spiraling out of control. Now we have so many people that are sick, so much mental health, so much everything, and the whole system and the whole world is overloaded with healthcare issues.

40:06
Tony: Really appreciate that that was, you know, I think, as a provider myself, I've definitely seen those issues in action, and I think there's a lot of truth there. Miss Talia, is that how you say your name? Sorry, yes. Okay, you had your hand raised too

40:21
Talya: yes I did. And so I just wanted to comment on the question of why people will go to a McDonald's and turn the tables over for cold fries but won’t go to a facility to get help.  As somebody who has been there done that. So I am coming from my own experience. I needed help, but because I didn't recognize I needed the help, I wouldn't go get it when I had those people who were saved letting me know, Talya there is a history tower. Talya there is a problem. But I couldn't see it. I didn't recognize that I had issues with alcohol until it got to the point that I wasn't able to take care of my son. I was so sick and I didn't like that, that's when I was able to now go and get the help that I needed. I was able to actually admit that I needed help, so its easy for somebody to walk into a restaurant get mad and be like you gave me cold fries.

41:57
Talya: You know, who is it? I think is it Burger King? Somebody said, you know, you

42:01
Talya: can have it your way. and so. But when it comes down to them, their own personal health problems, issues, whatever else it is, never, ever, ever, ever taken care of until you acknowledge for yourself that it actually exists. And that's, you know, something that I had to deal with, what I was now looking at right in the face, and somebody else had my son, because I was sick for days, and I did not like that. I understood then what everyone was saying, and came into agreement what everyone was saying, and I began to work on me that I could be the one that will walk into a facility and say, Hey, I raised my hand. I need help. I need assistance. You know, you know, things like that. That was a process that was not overnight. It was a process that took years to deal with all the different things that even down to the layer of why you probably drinking in the first place and dealing with, you know, things on a different level. So depending on where the person is, that could be, one of the major issues is, why would you go and be seen if you don't even recognize, that you have an issue going on

43:42
Tony: And I'm hearing that sometimes it takes a crisis to, you know, go and get help. And I'm also wanting to go back to, you know, when you're in that position where you know you're seeing the provider, because you've had the crisis and you're getting help, or maybe it's just because you realize it's time. But you know, you were mentioning that sometimes it's like, you don't, you don't say it, you don't, you don't, kind of tell the whole story. And sometimes, yeah, maybe that's on you, but maybe there's other things going on too, whether it's like shame or maybe fear that the doctor or the clinician isn't going to like, understand you or respect you. I don't know, you know, I'm curious if, if there's a dynamic going on there that prevents you from saying the whole story about, I have issues my memory, I got chronic pain, you know,

44:30
Mary: I know, for me, like it's I can speak from, like, being the child in the situation, like, for example, my mom is not a fluent English speaker, so that's own situation and barrier that happens. And I recognize when she goes to the hospital, there's this sense of, like, this authority complex that happens, right? But like, a doctor knows better than me, because they're a doctor, which is true, right? Because they're like, they have the training and all that. But then. The day, I always tried to tell her that you know your body better than a doctor does, and so if you have pain, you have pain. And sometimes the doctors, as others had alluded is that they will minimize that pain, right? Or maybe you didn't communicate it well enough to, like, let them know that, like, this is actually painful for me. This is something that's bothering me, and so with her, I always feel like I constantly have to fight with her doctor to get her pain communicated across. And that's really it's frustrating, because I understand that it's frustrating for her because she said it multiple times and like, the doctor doesn't seem to recognize it. Now I feel like I have to go in and actually, like, force my point, kind of speak up, yeah. And I don't want to do that because she's already done it, yeah. So that's the frustration that comes. And so I can understand her now wanting to go to the hospital anymore and only going there when it's actually, like critical, because then you can understand that I have pain, because it's obvious.

46:07
Bonnie: Yeah, but you have to be the advocate for your mom. So its not that you are arguing with the doctor. And it's not that you're taking it on. You're speaking on her behalf because she cannot clearly communicate to the doctor what her issue is. So you know, you come in with baggage, and then you take this baggage and you transfer it to other doctors, which isn't fair to them, you know, because they don't know when they're walking in. So you have to take ownership of that too, and that's why they call it practicing medicine, because everyone reacts differently to medications or treatments. So, you know, you know, Dr Tony, you know, Dr Tony, you shouldn't take full responsibility, or take responsibility. Oh, yeah, I've heard that in that experience that, no, you can't say that, because, once again, it's people coming together. And the baggage that they bring in which they need to, you know, make my experiences are completely different from your experiences, you know. So I'm a firm advocate of my own health, and sometimes I'm a little too firm in what I want, realizing that, okay, well, maybe that medication wasn't what I was supposed to have, even though I advocated for it. And then I realized, Okay, well, I guess the doctor did know better. Yeah? So, I mean, that's why, you know, I'm a firm advocate for for Mike's help, yeah? You know, if I see something and I think in my head what I need to get done, but I have to be open to what the doctor says, because they're trained. They see this every single day. Yeah, I'm just seeing this one time, whether it be my mom or him or myself.

47:31
Mary: For me, the issues when it's dismissed because it's an issue, that's my problem.

47:39
Bonnie: Yeah, okay, yeah. You can dismiss it once, but if it comes back again, I'm going to advocate for something. No, I don't think so. I want to do this. And you have to, you have to fight for yourself. You have to advocate for yourself. Yeah, so

47:53
Mary: I agree. For me, the issues, the fighting, I don't want to like

47:57
Bonnie: its not fighting, it's advocating it's completely different. Youre not coming in angrily, you have to come in calm, peaceful, and that way you can get your words out clearly, because you can come with anger that's all they hear, that's all they see, and that's how they get back

48:17
Timmy: and sorry, I just want to turn it to Mr. Timmy too, because that's how you were about to say something. I know when we're kind of bringing up this thing about, like, communication, I thought I heard you about to say something.

48:30
Timmy: No I wasn't, but I could Yeah, because, like, I think the name was Anne and yeah, spoke about

48:38
Yeah, and

48:39
Timmy: I have also that was my way of expressing my frustrations and my anger, yeah, you know. And you know, with the like mental health or substance abuse components, you don't know till you know you know what I mean, like, I don't know why, when I get in the argument, I decide to shoot you, stab you or punch you in the face, versus trying to talk to you until I realized there's another way to handle it. I mean, from where I came from, that may have been appropriate, yeah, during a certain period of time, you know, just like the turning over of the table may have been appropriate for that person at that time, you know, they understand it, until you know better. And then when you know better, you do better. You know, that's how, that's what I turned I came to believe, yeah, you know, as I learned more about what was going on with me when I was younger, yeah, and why certain things happen, yeah,

49:39
Timmy: and why I got into so many situations. You know, when I finally got a grip on that, I realized that I just didn't I wasn't diagnosed early enough, and I didn't take on the responsibility of my situation. You know, my issues, yeah, early enough. You know, people assume you're just crazy. You. You know what I mean, or lock his ass up. You know what I mean, one or the other. But you know it was like to, you know, give you the opportunity to learn, yeah, and be treated when necessary. You know, there is not much you can do

50:13
Tony:  speaking of opportunities and kind of like, you know, being in a situation. But part of what I was also thinking when I was listening to is sometimes like stereotypes, and I'm curious if, like, say, doctors or maybe providers, if you think that they may have different stereotypes for like black men versus like black women or black people.

50:31
Timmy: I grew up in Roxbury, but I was part of a program called Metco

50:36
okay,

50:37
Timmy: and I ended up, I hate to call the town, because I think I'm still banned from it.

50:46
Timmy: Wellesley, yeah, and

50:49
Timmy: it took me a long time to realize the damage they did to me. You understand, as a black person, yeah? Yeah. You know, kind of strong, aggressive, you know, not dumb, yeah, and not dumb, and that was part of the problem. I wasn't dumb, you know what I mean,

51:06
Timmy: so that you're like, almost like a threat.

51:09
Timmy: Yeah, they were, they were kind of, you know, who we think he is, or we think, you know, an athletic, you know, kind of things. But years later, you realize that, there was a whole lot of discrimination and stereotyping, and, you know, you were put in boxes. And, you know, I talked to my mother about it now, and I said, you just don't know. You know, what we went through me and my brothers, out there. That's why we fought so much. Yeah,

51:33
Tony: here's I was seeing a, like, a two way road. Honestly, it was why I brought it up,

51:39
Timmy: yeah, but you know again, until you know, you don't know,

Tony Pham  51:42
and I want to switch gears, and if it's okay, like folks, and feel free to stay after two, but you know, you don't have to stay after two. But you know, kind of in the same vein of like communication and memory stuff,

51:59
Tony: when we are in the early stages of experiencing changes in our memory, thinking about whether we might have some diagnosis, it is important to start doing things that can improve our brain health. And some of those things include like, physical activity, you know, stimulating mental activity, good sleep, avoiding substances that may aggravate, you know, our health. You know, some of this may include going to groups like exercise groups, or just finding ways to be active. I'm curious, you know, we've talked about this a little bit before. You know some of the issues in getting care, but I'm curious, even within predominantly black communities, what issues may arise that prevent oneself, one from getting these types of care, you know, again, like increasing physical activity, increasing mental stimulation, to prevent memory related issues from getting worse. It's okay, guys, just like, what are the barriers to getting care when it comes to, you know, physical health, mental health

53:04
Bonnie: yourself, you're the one. You're the barrier. Yeah, you're not open to it, and because you're not open to it, you're not going to do these things.

Tony: Yeah, I certainly seen that before.

53:14
Mike: There's also the lack of knowledge. And I know I'm contradicting myself, but all the, as I said earlier, all the different healthcare facilities. But, you know, I've heard stories of people who've gone to community health centers to seek mental health issues or behavioral health issues and been put on a given an appointment for six weeks later, which, which is ridiculous. That's why I'm a big fan of shopping around. Yeah, health center a says six weeks go to health center B, yeah, because they say the same tomorrow.

53:55
Mike: Or, you know, I hate to say this, because it's such a stereotype, but my dad used to really believe that you got better service if you went out into the suburbs,

54:08
Mike: I mean everything from health care to groceries,

54:11
Timmy: you going out there would get better, but they got better service.

54:15
Tony: would at least be there. Yeah,

54:19
Mike: we went grocery shopping in Dedham. We living in Roxbury, but damn if we didn't drive out to Dedham Hall. That's

54:24
Tony: sad and funny, because

54:26
Mike: he felt the food was better, yeah, so I think it comes to shopping around, yeah? But, you know, I want to go back to the stereotypes. You know, it's so funny because I've always believed that whenever, whenever you give the angry person, I'm not going to say black person, just angry black, Latino, Asian, whatever, whenever that person comes out, you've now given them an excuse to say, no,

54:59
Bonnie: yeah. Yeah, but isn't that what I just told you, what you manifest, what you give out is what you manifest back right? If you're coming out with an angry attitude, you're coming out with baggage. You're gonna get that back

55:11
Mike: you've given them the right to say you need to leave, Yeah, but

55:14
Bonnie: why? What? To be honest, don't you think they have the right that? I mean, you wouldn't sit there and take it if someone was yelling at you and telling you and telling you in demand, making all these demands, would you sit there and take it? You don't take it on the phone with customer service. Customer service, hang up the buck, right? So, you know, I don't understand why you feel that. Um,

55:33
Mike: that's, that's a good point, but

Timothy: it might just be simple, as, you know, frustration if I come and approach you in a respectful, you know, and well managed, civil manner, and you blow me off, and I'm like, Well, ladies, wait a minute. I'm just asking a question, you know. And you I'm done with it. I'm done with it now. That triggers my you know, it's an ongoing thing, and that happens often, you know. And I don't know if they do it intentionally or don't realize what they're doing, but you know, you can't be disrespectful to people.

56:10
Bonnie: I understand. I get your cover, but once again, your experiences, your baggages, are different from my experiences. Yeah, my bag, right? You know, I don't, I can't say knock on wood that the experiences that you've had, that I've had. So I'm sitting here listening to this, and it's very different from mine.

56:27
Timothy: Yeah, yeah. But you know, Timmy, you you hit it on the head. That was here. You can't come. You can't be disrespectful. Now let me here's where I'm going. One person, person interpretation of being disrespectful is another person's interpretation of being inquisitive. Yeah, I'm just, you know, Tony, you've heard me. Some folks have heard me say this. You know, my mom's generation grew up in this city where, back in the day, everybody went to Boston City Hospital. The reason why? Because if you went to Carney, if you went to Mass General, if you went to Brigham. You know all those hospitals today that want us to come in the door. The first question that was asked of you was not what was wrong, but do you have health insurance? And the answer was no, and they said, You need to go to city hospital. They took us nowadays, one of the questions and triage is asked what type of health insurance now, my mom translates that to, do you have health insurance? which means you don't want me here. Yeah, that's that whole disrespect thing.

57:34
Bonnie: No, that's about baggage. It's a different generation. You can't bring that baggage into this generation.

57:43
Timothy: How you just shake it, shake it. I mean, you know, if I've been kicked and stomped, you know, for 50 years, how would one day I just wake up and say, You know what, I'm going over here, and I'm going to leave all that 50 years of abuse behind,

57:59
Bonnie: That's how we grow, and that's how we learn, and that's how we advance, right?

58:04
Mary: Also an issue of competent care, right? Because I feel like providers, if you're going to work, for example, within a diverse city with every special population, you need to have competency in understanding the populations that you serve, and that's where a lot of the frustration comes from, because there's a lot of like, stereotyping that happens, like even the fact that becoming an MGH actually a really big privilege. And like, a lot of the people that are doctors come from privileged background, so a lot of them that haven't had experiences with people come from low income backgrounds. People are black, and so there's a lot of like ignorance, right? That happens of culture, of person, of trauma, and it's not just personal trauma, it's historical trauma. So you need to be able to understand that, and that's where a lot of the frustration comes from with people where they feel dismissed. It's no longer like I’m dismissed. It that my mom has felt this. My children have felt dismissed, my grandparents, and so that's a lot of like, the evasion from healthcare comes to that there's such a complexity there that, like, I feel like is not that's something that we need to talk about.

59:17
Bonnie: Yeah, but that to that new doctor, young doctor, like you, doctor, ma'am, it's, is it fair for you to have to take the brunt of all this history and you're, you're getting knocked on the head because of that. That's not fair to you. You're like, whoa. Hold on. A second here. I didn't know all of this.

59:33
Tony: It’s a deep question, and I'll kind of end it with, you know, I do recognize that there's no right or wrong answer, but I will say, I will say that I think that miscommunication happens like a miscommunication has happened in my life. A lot of times. People will sometimes say to me, like, Well, why are you so angry? And I'm not angry. It just maybe it sounded like that. And I think that kind of going back to what you said, that can trigger you, and sometimes that different baggage, kind. Of like, reverberates. And no one wanted it to reverberate, but it just does. And I think that both sides can probably, you know, have a better awareness of the situation. But just the transition, we were just talking about communication stuff, what'd you say? Okay, Miss Cynthia, yeah, go for it. Miss Cynthia, you had your hand up.

1:00:21
Cynthia: Oh, thank you all for noticing me.

1:00:32
Cynthia: I just wanted to just make a quick comment. You know, when we're talking about baggage and things like that, but we're also talking about mental health issues. And so when we start using words like baggage and people being safe, to go and be open to say, Hey, this is where I'm at. So I'm totally vulnerable. I'm totally open. And if you see my stuff as well, you're you're carrying baggage, and you're putting it off on the world, and it's like, but the world has put it off on you, and that's why you got the baggage. But then you shouldn't express the baggage that the world put on you, to just hold it. Then that's mental health to go see. You know, it's just like I said, perpetuating cycle that we may not even recognize. A quick example, I just came from the courthouse, and I haven't been there in a long time, the one downtown, and I'm looking down over the banister, and they have these, I guess maybe for Black History Month, or, I don't know, whatever they did, but they had up the scene for the bussing, you know, the bussing that happened back in the 70s. And I'm looking down and the ice, and I'm saying to myself, Wow, that was me. That was me on that bus being escorted by police. That was me. But when, then, when you add to that of people's real life experience, and I see more racism happening with me as I get older, it's happening, but it brings back the same thing that happened when I was on those busses as a little girl being shipped somewhere else, and the adults were attacking. So it was, it was just kind of this thing. I didn't even expect that to be in the in the courthouse, because look down and it was just like it wasn't even a triggering moment, but it was a moment of humbleness to say, Wow, that was me. I didn't even know I would be on this call today to even have this conversation, but wow, that was me. So maybe just just be kind of careful when we start using words like baggage, and we're talking about mental health and people trying to get support and service and deal with some of the stuff that they need to unload, because no place has allowed them to unload.

1:02:56
Tony: Yeah, these are, these are great topics. And you know, honestly, if y'all are interested, you can Google the psychologists call like transference and counter transference, this idea that we kind of bring our experiences to the table and that can color our interactions and how we see other people from like a forwarding perspective. You know, you see your psychiatrist and he looks like your dad, you might bring that transference and start to see them like your dad, that you know you think about also in relation to historical trauma. But I also want to transition to another important topic. It's about a relationship to memory related problems. And you know what brought up this, this idea that, you know, there are things we can do to prevent these diagnoses or at least delay them, like whether it's Alzheimer's or whatnot, and you know, includes increasing physical activity, because sometimes, at least from the data and the research, like issues like chronic pain, can exacerbate or worsen our memory issues in such a way that, say, like, when your pain flares up, like your memory and concentration gets worse, and then that kind of feeds back and forth and can cause issues. But I'm curious, you know, that's just mostly like a theoretical explanation that, like I've read and heard about and sometimes seen in the clinic. But I'm curious from y'all perspective, you know, because we're also here as people who, not me, who have had a history of chronic pain. And I'm curious if y'all have at least seen in yourself or other people a relationship between pain and memory issues.

1:04:29
Nadine: That's like the conversation that I was having with Miss Mary. And I was saying that a lot of times, I think because of the fact, like, some kind of being in pain, that your mind is not, like, really focused on the things you're doing or you're trying to do, because it's more so focused on the pain. Or the stuff that you're going through this pain wise,

1:05:09
Tony: no worries, yeah, anyone wants to know it's okay, if anyone wants to piggyback off that or even express their thoughts on it, if they if not, they've never experienced such a relationship before.

1:05:27
Timothy: I know, I know, for me, anyway, my experience with pain has been when you're in pain, serious pain, it's all consuming, nothing else matters, except trying to alleviate that pain,

1:05:37
Tony: so it's hard to take care of yourself in general.

1:05:40
Timothy: I mean, you don't care who you yelling at, who you screaming at, who you got to do, you know, you want to get rid of that pain. That's my experience. Yeah,

1:05:52
Mike: and I'm gonna piggyback on timing, because I remember my experience the first time. I'd never been hurt like that before, and the more I could not get, I fractured my ankle, and I couldn't get up and and the harder it was for me to try and get up, the more scary is the only word that comes to mind, because, because your helpless. Yeah, you know, and, and you don't know what to do. And I'm thinking, if this was a chronic pain type of thing, that I know that if I do this, this is going to happen, and it's going to be painful, but I have to do it, you know? I got to get out of the bed. I got to walk up those stairs, you know, I got to put on my shoes. I'm afraid to do it, because I know it's going to be painful. And so I'm fighting with myself, yeah, and that's, that's what I'm going with, that that inner fight of, I have to do this, but damn, I don't want to have to. You know, I love when they do the pain scale from one to 10 and they ask me how you feel. I'm like, You need to understand one to eight is

1:07:08
Mike: discomfort.

1:07:10
Mike: 9 and 10 drops me to my knees and tears to come to my eyes, right? That's pain, and when I hit that mark, that for me, is confusing. It's like, what am I supposed to do? Because I'm not used to that.

1:07:33
Tony: Anyone in the Zoom world have thoughts on that, no worries if you don't, but just wanted to pass the mic in case folks were waiting.

1:07:41
Cynthia: Oh, yeah, what's up? And in the chat I just put in, you know, for me, the I find myself, the happier I am, and the busier I am, the less I recognize the pain that I have, or I start off with pain. And as I go, go, go, after a while I'll check my neck. I'm like, Oh, my neck is not hurting anymore. But when I'm actually sitting and not doing much of anything, it's there. It is stiff. It is, you feel it is, if the pain is there, you know, it brings on headaches and all the other stuff. And so I tried to just kind of okay, tight muscles. Let me loosen them up. Loosen them up, but then I went and got a massage. And after the massage, my head was hurting so bad, I'm like, Okay, I don't know if that was a bad massage or what, you know, but I guess maybe just the tension around and that the area and the inflammation and everything else, it just gave me a headache for days.

Tony Pham  1:08:41
And just to kind of read off other things going on in the chat, Ms Anne said sometimes people may not be able to get transportation to and from they're not eligible, in some cases, for those services. And I think that was in relation to like, getting care and like Ms, Cynthia said she also said we were not able to go to other hospitals. So actually going off what Miss Cynthia said, this idea of like, you know, being happier and more active and noticing less about pain. You know, this whole conversation that we're having is because, you know our group at Mass General, Mr. Kincaid and Mary and Noman, you know, where we're thinking about ways to create more self sustainable activity programs in community spaces to address issues like chronic pain and memory related issues. We also have another program we're working on for like depression and so forth. But I think that a lot of these programs that we're going to base it off of, they weren't made for people who say come from a predominantly black neighborhood, or people who might identify as black. And I bring that up because sometimes the packaging of a therapy is important too, or even the contents of it or its basic values and principles. Because if you don't, if you're not feeling a therapy, then you might not get it. And if you're getting it, it might make it Even worse. So I'm curious about what y'all thoughts are about some of the components that we'll be using as like a template as we deliver this intervention in the community, for folks, say, in this context, who have chronic pain and memory related questions and concerns and so this this therapy that we're basing it off of. You don't have to remember this, but they call it mindfulness based cognitive therapy, and that's a really complicated way of saying it's got stuff like meditation and yoga, stretching exercises and a bit of talk therapy as well. So we've kind of taking things piece by piece, and again, I recognize we're going after two. So if anyone has to go, I won't, we won't be offended, but we'd love to just, you know, if it's possible, continue hearing your thoughts. But you know, let's, let's take one thing that's a component of this therapy we're thinking about putting into the community for folks who have issues, say, with chronic pain and memory related issues, but like meditation and yoga. Um, there's evidence to support these types of activities to alleviate pain and to improve memory. But when you think about getting meditation or yoga, you know, is it a does it sound like a good thing or bad thing? What are your What are your snap thoughts when you hear those terms? Or do you even, like recognize?

1:11:28
Timothy: Well, not. I'm not familiar with either practice. I've never tried you either one, but I know what they are. Yeah, you know. And I guess it depends on whether you're interested in trying to have the discipline to do it on a regular basis, because that's, you know, that's my thing. My thing is, like, there's things I know I should do, yeah, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna do it

1:11:50
Tony: Yeah, and it's okay if I can dig, like, Why do you think it was something that you haven't like gone towards in the past? No worries.

1:12:00
Timothy: with me, it's basically just the, I guess, access or advice, you know, that I come from and around. It wasn't necessarily there or, you know,

1:12:15
Timothy: wasn't available. I

1:12:17
Timothy: it may have been available, but not promoting so I may not have known about it. Okay. Well, I do remember a couple studios down, definitely they're no longer there, but yeah, years ago, yeah, yeah, we

1:12:28
Tony: were just talking about some of the therapies that we're thinking about introducing in the community to address like pain and memory related issues. And so we're just talking about what people's thoughts were with individual components, and we just brought up meditation and yoga.

1:12:44
Nadine: And I try to at one point, but it's been a very hard thing to do, and I've had a referral for years, and I still don't seem to have gotten into that particular services, the holistic approach to, you know, as opposed to taking medicine and stuff like that, and to be able to find more healthy ways to be able to deal with the pain. And I, I'm not a person who's really into taking medication, but sometimes, oh my goodness, I'm just hurting so bad. That's what I want, a pill, a pill right now, maybe a couple of pills, okay? Because the pain is just like, radiating through my body and whatnot, and, you know, like, but I would really like to find an alternative to that,

Tony Pham  1:13:40
like medications and so forth, I see, and then just taking zoom. But, you know, one of the things that we also think about is how a lot of these terms may sound kind of foreign, maybe because one's not familiar with them, but also they one may associate them with, like other religious practices, or like Asian practices, like especially like yoga and meditation. And when you hear those words, do you think, like, if we're delivering it in the community, that we need to change the way that that it's worded or delivered?

1:14:18
Nadine: I don't think meditation helps my pain at all. That's just a form of, you know, like a mindset thing. It might ease my mind, or, you know, calm my spirit, or whatever, but, as far as you know, like, for pain, Yeah, nah, that's just no.

1:14:39
Tony: I think that's very reasonable to say, because also pain comes in different amounts
Nadine: even I can’t do chair

1:14:43
Nadine: yoga, talking about a chair yoga, okay, I'm in so much pain that I can't do that, and at the end of the day, because of the level of pain, I'm not even gonna try that. Okay? Because I'm not gonna, I'm not going to put myselfvin subject to more pain, you know. So some things I just don't do because of that fact, because I'm already hurting. I'm already in pain from head to toe, fingertips to toe tips and so a lot of things I don't do, a lot of things I try to do, though, because I come from a healthcare background, and I know the older days is that if you don't use it, you lose it. So I try to walk what I can. But then some days that's not what I want to do. Some days, when the pain is radiating so bad. I think clearly about my mother Okay, and I watch my mother just really like lose her abilities to use it, because, I mean, she lost it because she didn't use it. And I think about the fact that I'm like some days, I can clearly see okay, and identify with why at the end of the day, my mother just completely stopped walking, just something that she just stopped doing, because it's so excruciating, the pain and everything that I that I go through, but I just can't give up on me like that. I just can't stop in let you know my body really, I'm really just gonna have to fall down dead before I sit down. Okay, yeah, in bed. Okay, so, but

1:16:38
Tony: sounds like you're a survivor. Yeah? Like, doing what you got to do?

1:16:47
Tony: yeah, no, that's really great. And you know, I think you really are right there in the sense that there's, there's, there's like levels of issues, like with pain, where some of these therapies can be helpful, and it's not like severe pain, because that might be something like recent, it could be like acute or recent injury, or it could be so overwhelming that it's hard to And yet, there is, you know, still evidence for just not, like at all levels of pain or memory issues. And I think that's really worth knowing, too, and keeping in mind, when we deliver this. You know, we can't be bringing everyone into the group if they're like in excruciating pain. And, okay, hey, how is it going from the Zoom side? Yeah. So

1:17:33
Cynthia: you piling up over here? Oh, yeah. So just real quick. I just have to say something about the yoga thing, and I've mentioned this in the past, so wording is important to me. You know, I have no problem with I tried to do stretching and things like that, not as much as I should. But, you know, regularly, because I have so much stiffness in my neck and back and shoulders, have to keep moving like five, six times a day, just cracking my neck and turning. I'm constantly doing that. But it's it is painful, but, but then when I hear things like yoga, specifically, because I can, in my mind, I can shift meditation to something else through a level that I can receive right depending on what it is that I'm meditating on, but the yoga specifically knowing the foundation of where it came from. And you know, people can add whatever they want to add to it, or however they receive it. But for me, if you told me I want you to come to a yoga class, I'm telling you right now, back all the way back up and say, Yeah, tell me that I'm going to a class where we're exercising, and we're going to be doing some stretching. I have no problem with that. But I do are very sensitive to understand that certain things are very much related to a religious portion of yoga, and we just want to make sure that we are respectful of one another's belief system and not unintentionally have people involved in things that they don't want to be. You know what I mean? The face of it looks like one thing, but has you doing something else. So we just want to make sure that you know, with the whether it be stretching exercises or whatever, that we stay true to what we say it is. If you say it's yoga, then it's Yoga. But if it's going to be just stretching exercises which incorporates kind of everyone then, then that needs to be presented in that way, I

1:19:53
Tony: appreciate that. And Mr. Talya , can you hear us Ms, Talya , I see your hand is raised. I

1:20:01
Tony: think Sandra was first. Oh, okay, oops. I

1:20:04
didn't see there's so many hands. Miss. Sandra,

1:20:08
Sandra: hi, thank you, Talya

1:20:10
Sandra: I just wanted to kind of comment on the exercising and the chronic pain. I do live with chronic pain. I am on pain medication three times a day, and I hate it. I hate it so much because I feel like my body is now dependent upon it, and it sucks because I'm in recovery, and it's like a fine line, and I do take it as prescribed,

1:20:37
Sandra: but it bothers with me, emotionally, mentally and spiritually, because, again, in recovery, and have been over 37 years. And so,

1:20:49
Sandra: you know, I, I keep, you know, my mind, you know, plays like these little tricks. I mean, I don't know if it's my disease or whatever. Saying, okay, you don't deserve, you know, the time that you have away from your drug and choices, because the doctors have you on this medication. Gabapentin is not a big pain medication, but it's still something that your body depends on to get through the pain. So that's why we're so interested in this group. Because if there's some alternatives, and I've tried yoga, it's not for me, I have a concentration problem, just like even when I'm reading. I'm a great reader, but I don't always comprehend. I have to read it a few times, and I think the same being said with exercise, and I'm lazy about that. However, I go to physical therapy because they say it helps. It hurts more than it helps. However, I continue to go because that's what the doctors say, and I do trust my team. I'm living with liver cancer. I'm on a transplant list for liver so, you know, I feel like I'm limited to some of the things I can do, but anything that can get me from stop taking Gabapentin or anything else add. No, I can't take a lot of stuff because of my liver disease, but it's just like a fine line, and it's kind of hard. And I have

1:21:59
Sandra: tried yoga, I've tried exercising,

1:22:03
Sandra: but I still need to take this medication. And I don't know if it's a mind thing, mind over matter. You know, some people speak that, and sometimes I do, but I just know that, like, the pain is always there, and I have some serious things going on with me and my back now, there's surgeries they could probably possibly repair it, but they're not guaranteed, so I'm afraid of that, and I don't really at my age, I'm 67 I'm afraid to go under the knife. I don't have to, and it's scary even thinking about the liver transplant at this age. But anyway, those are just some of my thoughts, and I just kind of wanted to share because I hadn't participated. Much just listening. And I did hear everybody very interesting subjects. And thank you everybody for participating and sharing. It helped me. Thank you.

1:22:51
Tony: No worries. Ms Sandra, and I really appreciate you saying that. I actually want to go back to it in a second, because you raised some really important points. I should just briefly say, though, you know, sometimes we need one kind of treatment, sometimes we need another kind of treatment, and sometimes we need both, and there's no issues there. It's just a matter of figuring out what works for us and what we really do need. Ms Talya

1:23:17
Talya: yes, yes. And so I know we're all thinking exercise, but what I'm actually thinking is, what are we eating? Yeah, you know, the things that we put in there, you guys say there are different things that we can eat that should promote brain health or support brain health. So I think of things like, you know, plant based diet. Think of things like detoxing, to clean out the impurities in your body, you know, get rid of all of the pesticides, stuff like that, parasites that are in your body, you know. So I'm thinking Whole Health as well when it comes down to, what are we eating? Because there's a lot of these foods that have so many different chemicals and everything in it, and we're placing it in our body, but we have no clue of the effects that is having because we're consuming and so if we're eating healthy, if we're doing things like exercising, if we're drinking water, instead of placing all of these things that have different dyes, they actually have an app called yuka, y, u, K, A, it looks like a parrot. You actually can go in the store and scan in the barcode, and it will tell you if what you scanned in is actually good. It actually takes all the information that's in that one product, so if it has red dyes and things like that, I actually picked up a box of what is it? Shredded Wheat without sugar. And I thought I was doing a good thing, because it's shredded wheat and it's made with wine soup. But when I scanned it in, I found out that it had a extremely harmful, harmful chemical in it that lets me know not to eat that, everything else was good, except for this one chemical that is extremely harmful to the body. And so I think you know, if we even incorporate something like that into our diets, of detoxing that we're eating plant based as much as you can that fruites the vegetables, even if you have an opportunity to grow your own vegetables, and you know at that point that there's no chemicals or anything growing on the vegetables, then you can live that healthier life and possibly live even with the healthier mind. And so that's what I was thinking.

Tony Pham  1:26:01
That's a great point. And you know, kind of building off that, I'm curious if folks might want to chime in about things that are more often seen, say in black communities versus other communities, that may be helpful for, like, pain and memory related issues. And you know, coming from an Asian background, you know, if I'm having pain, my mom might give me like some tiger bomb, but I that's not like in every household, right? So I'm curious, you know, whether it comes to particular diets, particular practices, maybe like prayer or even like connecting with your pastor. I'm just curious if there are things that maybe we should include or incorporate or keep in mind as a part of this program that we're building that might make it more helpful, honestly. Well, I will actually just kind of ask you all for feedback, because, you know, we are also and feel free to interrupt me. We're also thinking about including some things to make say meditation and yoga more more applicable, more acceptable when we start to deliver it in community spaces, and one of which was, you know, meditation, like what Miss Cynthia was saying, may not, you know,

1:27:19
Tony: sound correct when people are coming to get it. And I'm curious what y'all think about say, including things like prayer, which is very similar when you think about it, to like meditation. You're sitting there, you're reflecting your your removing, your kind of centering your brain around something else so that you can kind of act and move.

1:27:39
Nadine: That's what I do a lot. Okay? When I maintain, I start to pray, because, like, you know, yeah, make it, you know, just make it go away and whatnot. But, like I said, everything is not for everybody. Okay? Like, I participate in meditation, and I participate in in the yogas, but I can't do everything and every exercise that they're asking to be done because of the function and abnormality of my body. Okay? So I can't do everything, so some things I'm that's what I'm doing. I'm just sitting in a kid, yeah, how about that? Right? Okay, wow, you know so, and it's not that I'm not participating, which it may seem like to others, but to me, it's because it's trigger factors, and it's things that trigger the pain, you know, in my body and whatnot. So,

1:28:48
yeah, no, i Mr. King, no, no, no, you

1:28:51
Mike: know what I'm you know, you guys know me. I'm big on leaving with a cliffhanger, yeah? And what I'm think, what I'm thinking and what I'm hearing is it's about packaging, yeah, and so maybe, you know, our homework should be, you know, how else would you describe yoga? That's, I don't want to say acceptable, but relevant, yeah, you know. How do you describe meditation? Like you said,

1:29:16
Mike: I, you know,

1:29:17
Mike: I never thought of the fact that prayer and meditation very similar, yeah, you know, I don't, I've only taken one yoga class in my entire life. What did I walk away from it thinking, this is just stretching. So, I mean, but I mean, the point is, is, let's brainstorm on how to package this, yeah, so that it's culturally acceptable.

1:29:39
Timothy: I just didn't know, you like the young lady on the Zoom, I don't know she mentioned, you know, the religious aspect, and I never associated it too. So now, you know, I'm gonna look further to find out. You know, whether you know what it is, yeah, because I've never associated, I never associated yoga with a religion.
Tony: So that's good.
Timothy: That might be my ignorance. I don't know.
Tony: It sound also it has not been something you have explored
Timothy: I hear so many people talking about involved in yoga now especially in in the black community. That has not been something that was always around in our community but I am hearing a a lot of it right now, especially with this USB. You hear a lot in those zoom calls about yoga and meditation. I don’t know I have not heard you package. I don’t know how you are delivering it and I can’t comment on that.

1:30:18 ~ Mary hand typed notes from here onwards
Nadine: But I think he is trying to formulate the package.  The package is not there yet.
Timothy: No matter what you are saleing, I don’t think there is only one way to do it. So there is always going to be different ways of folks and different people.

1:30:39
Tony: One thing I was thinking about too is the physical exercises. It is hard to have one exercise that fits for everyone, whether it is chair yoga, some of the advanced yoga postures, or even like walking. I am curious if there might be come universal ones where most folks, especially folks coming from black communities or communities of color that they may be most interested in, whether it is chair yoga. Seems like chair yoga is not for you, but maybe for someone else it is

1:31:11
Nadine: No, there are somethings that I can do in chair yoga and somethings that I just can’t because that is my pain trigger for me to do those, so why am I going to indulge in something that is going to cause me to have pain you know, so that is me like being narcissistic or whatever I like pain
Tony: One thing I hear is giving people the space to not do an exercises
Nadine: yes, exactly
Mike: Something that we gotta be conscious of. There is no set thing that black people do. And the images that just popped in my mind, is you go to the golf course and have a couple of walking clubs and you also have the couple of sisters jogging, and playing tennis in the club and one with that
Nadine: you also have people in the club just eating
Mike: well I am talking about exercise.
Nadine: yea, I am exercising my mouth

1:32:20
Mike: As someone who likes playing the gold course. When I am out there playing golf that is exercise. But where I am going with this, there is no one definitive that black people do this type of thing. So I think through.
Mary: so do you think it would be better if there were a few sets of activities that we can offer. Instead of just one, right.
Tony: That is cool.
Mary: Maybe there is the modified yoga, the chair yoga, the standing yoga, maybe like a walk. Just like five different activities that somebody can vibe with.
Mike: what they say is low impact, and high impact. If you want to be like people like her and run around the gold course, go for it.
Mary: This is reminding me of the road to wellness thing, where it is a 5k where you can walk, or run, or jog, or speed walk. So there is different ways you can complete that activity. So it is not just one way and it accommodates people’s different physical abilities and needs. So something like that.

1:33:43
Tony: maybe we can help people connect with other activities or connect with other people to start doing other stuff, if it is playing golf or playing tennis.
Timothy: I have been trying to access a pool
Tony: I think having that conversation started. People will know about local pools and stuff that I won’t. And kind of, and by the way just a reminder we are almost done but if you have to go no worries again. You know when it comes to talk therapy is there anyway that we can make that a more acceptable practice. We have been talking a lot about talking and communicating and seeking help and when we are thinking about this intervention, typically it is in a group maybe 8 people or so. Maybe more maybe less. And you know typically people talk, but it is usually the instructor talking. And not so much the people who are there. And I am curious when it comes to that part, what would make it more acceptable, like this idea of talking about.

1:34:55
Mike: a different title. Talk therapy sounds to me like I am seating there listening to people tell me about my problems. And expecting me to respond. It is just the word talking therapy that don’t. Yeah.
Tony: different word.
Mike: we all say this. Different words say different things. In other words make it sound less clinical.

1:35:23
Tony: Yeah, no I love that. And if y’all have, I know it is hard to come up with new idea right on the stop but if you have any ideas of new ways to describe meditation, new ways to describe yoga, new ways to describe talk therapy you know feel free to share them. There is no right or wrong answer. But I also was thinking about other things that we might include. One thing about this type of intervention, it is usually not considered a group therapy but I have heard that a lot of times when people were coming to groups they want it to be like a group therapy and is group therapy important or do you think that that it may take away from the experience of getting the instructor’s information and guidance.
Timothy: I think that that it is. I am new to the USB thing and I do the zoom thing, quite often enough. And to me it seems like these types of groups or those types of groups are therapeutic. You know for the participants and, you know what I mean. People are participating for a reason and some of them are like, you know to, not all some of the groups people get a chance to experience things that are on there mind and seek advice and suggestion from others. I was there and it was like a therapy session.

1:36:53
Tony: so it sounds like story sharing is really important
Timothy: Well I mean it is usually personal, you know. It is not stories. It is personal stories.
Nadine: and everybody is not comfortable with that either.
Timothy: but I am saying that to a greater, to a large extent I hear a lot of that  and I consider that to be therapeutic or it seems to me to be therapeutic.
Nadine: And sometime I feel like you have to look at the players. Look at who is in the room in order for you to feel comfortable and what you feel and what you have to say. Okay. So is to not basically just start expressing yourself in front of everybody. Exactly, so.

1:37:49
Timonthy: well there is limitations to these types of community settings. You know.
Nadine: it is limitations if you limit yourself but if you get up there and you start blase blase and you are saying and telling your story in a way where you know like I feel or you might feel that should be personal, that should not be, is not something I would want to even indulge in. This is where I opt out of the meeting okay because some of the things said, I might to have been in this meeting had I known the language or different stuff or where ever. That again, that depends on the shoe fits wear it, and the shoe is not going to fit everybody.
Tony: good feedback

1:39:00
Cnythia: I will say, so what I am thinking is what is the goal of talk therapy. I am thinking that is the first thing to consider. Are we coming together to share about our pain or are we there to lead something and to think something. That means there was to be something although people may be over sharing about pain it can’t be just about you sharing about how awful your pain is, it also has to be a positive part of it to say hey here is some suggestions or why don’t we as a take home why don’t we try this. and see what the results are or whatever. Something positive on the back end has to be at the end of talk therapy it can’t be you just pouring out and talking about pain pain pain. Just from my experience with other situations not even the pain, but when you pour out a lot of negative into an atmosphere and you leave people there then you have left them in a worse situation than they came in and everyone is coming to agreement with whatever one is saying but no one has given any solutions to how do we help this pain or sort through some of this. So just making sure that we, when there is a close off to a meeting like that there has to be something positive that you are closing off with.

1:40:23
Tony: I love that.
Mike: That has gotta be a point. Thank you Cynthia. Tony we have to make sure that always happens. Ends on a positive note.
Tony: Thank you so much. This is really great feedback. And just other stuff that we are thinking about. It is all about making people feel more comfortable, you know, and some people have brough up like what if we include like knitting and kwiliting, just as people are seating there. Do you think that would be too much or just including these activities might make people feel more comfortable.

1:40:51
Nadine: Okay I am going to speak on that too. It depends on what type of pain a person has and their. Because some people do not have the physical ability to knit, okay. And might not want to get up in a room and say that to somebody because of you might have something with your joints, with your fingers and knitting is not something that you can do.

1:41:24
Tony: Arthritis
Nadine: I think it should be more broad and more wide stream. Like me, I used to do a lot of art, okay. I used to do from the time I was 22 years old my life event planning and stuff like that. I used to make all of the ornaments, the designs whatever and whatnot. Then I got to a point where that is not what I can do, but I will get in a room and I minimize myself to what I know that I able to do okay. I do not try to go above and beyond and stretch myself with you want to stretch me. I have to meet me where I am at, okay. I can’t go where you want me to go and so, and if I can’t go where you want me to go that is not going to work for me, okay. I have to do me and be me, my way, okay. And I think that should be across the board for everybody, because people sometime have limitations and what not and you are asking someone to join a knitting, I can pearl one and knit two and then I am done, how about that, and I don’t know what you might have, okay, but I don’t think it is going to be a scarf. But that is my project, that you know, I was able to do and stuff, so I think it should be more like broad stream that you ask people what in this general station do you feel like you can do, okay, that is at your peak, at your comfortability.

1:43:25
Tony: I like that a lot and I think that hearing you makes me think that we should just have things for people to do based on what they want to do...I was just thinking that we can bring the knitting needle if they like, we can bring the fabric if they want to use it. Is there anything else that we can bring to make people feel more comfortable, whether it is like squishy balls, art materials
Nadine: Yes like you can bring something like
Tony: Something that they can use when they are talking or meditating
Nadine: Exactly, exactly

1:43:59
Mike: let me make a suggestion. Why don’t you ask the group in the early days exactly the questions that you are asking
Tony: like when we are delivering it.
Mike: Ask them because also it inspires them to come back to see what you brought
Tony: yeah. I love it. Another thing, just trying to be mindful of time, but another innovation that we are trying to bring is usually these types of therapies are delivered by white people from a higher socioeconomic background, typically a white neighborhood and you now it is harder to find you know people of color to take on this role of like the instructor, because they might be too busy, or they don’t have ten thousand dollars to throw just to get the certificate you know. So we are really looking at how can we get people from the community to deliver this intervention. They will be trained but they don’t have to spend like ten thousand dollars and maybe they can teach someone else to teach the course on different periods so that it is a sustainable program, rather than something that a select amount of people can do.

1:45:10
Tony: I am curious when you think about it, a therapy or a program that is delivered in that way do you feel that is something you would have faith in or no I need like MD, PhD or something like that.

1:45:21
Mike: I think it shows ownership...folks in the community are running the program, it shows ownership of the community. And I believe we got some people that have already volunteered, to help.
Tony: yeah, I think miss Cynthia has already volunteered for one too..it is not just volunteer, I think that in the future it would be something that essentially people are volunteering because there is this hope that it won’t rely on like a grant funding as we currently have through the government or mass general but it is purely funded through the community.

1:46:09
Tony: on the topic on this being a little longer than we anticipated, is there a time length that y’all were thinking of when it comes to this program that would be the right amount per session. Typically I would say this program is delivered eight times once per week, each time for two hours. So again that is two hours sessions once per week for 8 weeks. Is that too long, too frequent, right is that okay?
Nadine: I think that is just about okay because it gives a person a chance to get in a room, get they self comfortable, get their bearings, and to be able to work on whatever project it is that they have and then leave some for the next time. And so I have two hours so I am feeling myself, I am getting my supplies together, and you know getting them in front of me, and what not and then I am doing my thing, and then probably two hours is the most that I, and maybe other people my age and stuff or whatever that are getting up in age might really even want to do, you know, so

1:47:27
Mary: would you want this be like in person, or a hybrid situation, or would you like an in person and virtual option
Nadine: like the conversation we have earlier you and I to make it fit for everyone, okay. Like right now we are doing it both ways. Okay, so that is what fits for them right now, and this is what fits for me right now, okay. I think too that you know like there should be time management, okay, that we if we have to leave early or whatever, there is an emergency or whatever understandable but if you are gonna show up to try to show up where you are showing up at the space when the space opens so there for whatever anybody else is doing there is not an interruption when you come in an hour or an hour half later, basically and what not. And that sometime we will make a destruction for somebody else

1:48:53
Tony: so what I am putting together I think that one thing my parents is that options are really important, and giving people the option to come in virtually or to come in person it also makes me think that we should give people the option to stay as long as they want or as short as they want but if we do we have to make sure that is managed so people aren’t getting interrupted and disrupting other people. Nadine: exactly what you are hearing

1:49:21
Mike: again that is staff that can be planned on the fly...so just like the 8 weeks his reality is that, the 8 weeks is going to allow the group to bond. This is an 8 week program but it can have the option of continuing on beyond that 8 weeks. Because that first 8 weeks it is a pilot and that is the tweaking and that is the  you know lets try this, lets try that, that works, that did not work. But it does not mean just because it did not work with this group we never do it again. The 8 week is a pilot and what is going to happen is that group should bond. I know I have done this. I have been part of pilots and at the end people want to keep going because they have connected. They got that commonality and so that is where the job becomes. Hopefully leaders step up to continue it on so that you can take the pilot and go to some place else and start it again knowing that is on it’s own. I am not saying never go back, it is just that you know they got this.

1:50:34
Tony: yeah. I really love that, and I think that is why we are really trying to step away from a select people being able to lead this program, because we want people to step up to and to teach other people when they may be sick or maybe they are going to do it at a certain place. And another person can be up the helm of responsibility and kinda lead the group. My last question, sorry y’all

1:51:05
Cynthia: I want to chime in on the time part. I think that it would be good as you are talking about having that lead way with time right, and so I think an hour and half really would work because the flexibility of the hour and half would rather be in the beginning because people really aren’t there and you would want to wait a little longer or if at the end a closing out and it is still not all the way closed. You gotta leave, if you put it at two hours people are...finished at one or two hours then it is all this overlapping time. So just as a suggestion you know you may want to do it at an hour and half and that extra 30 minutes if kind of that buffer time. To start 15 minutes later or to or you are closing out and there is still a lot of conversation. The place you use a lot of times when you say you are leaving at this time, they expect you to leave. From 6-8 they expect you to leave at 8 when you are trying to end it at 8, now you gotta get everybody and it is pushing to 8:30. Kinda what you find.

1:52:333
Tony: That is funny, it reminds me of going to concerts or something.
Nadine: But if you have a function and you go to a function hall okay and they say 6-8, you don’t have to be there at 6 but you need to be out of there by 8. So you know
Mike: what he did today telling us it was 12-2
Nadine: but then he added ...
Mike: I am just messing with you

1:52:51
Tony: Last question just thinking about location and I know I listed some, I know some of us meet through union capital, folks were familiar with central Boston, and there is certain places in the community. I am just spit balling ideas if there are certain locations y’all think this kind of program or at least in the beginning or in the future would be a great place to be delivered that is accessible, people want to go there, people feel comfortable being there.

1:53:19
Cynthia: Where are you all at right now. I have no idea
Tony: we are at Grove Hall library off Gineva
Cynthia: Okay. There you go one of the libraries
Tony: Yeah, I think Grove Hall is certainly one
Cynthia: or you know one place over there, or the Grove Hall, those are easily accessible
Mike: And it’s got parking. We also got right next to this, connected to this, is the senior center. You know which is got space for physical activity.
Nadine: I was also going to say the crocs center, they have a senior program there too and instead of you saying, it is every week...and right now the croc center it is a nice place, but they changed their, changed hands over, so it is not like it used to be and it needs an uplift or an uptake to have some sort of activity or whatever to be able to you know

1:53:40
Tony: I did go there one time. I think AARP had this event there is one time. That is so cool, these are all these really great ideas. Any last comments or questions or anything you want to chime in with. I am super thankful that y’all came virtually or in person, stayed the extra time, and talked with us, and honestly our group is feeling really rapped up. I think we have been working hard on making the manual, it is just a lot of work and we want to get as much feedback as we can before we complete it and send it off. Hopefully meet again with you all at some point and to just get more feedback. But any last comments or questions.
Cynthia: Just make sure you save the chat cuz there is things that are in there.
Tony: Yeah, well I won’t close the chat just yet. All right y’all again I know we stayed the extra time and just in terms of other logistics we will be in touch. We are actually trying to figure our a better way to send compensation because what we typically do is we send something an echeck and it basically we just need your name, your address, and your social and we send that amount which in person is $260 virtual is $250 and we mail that to you. Which can take a little longer than giving a gift card right now  which is what I ideally would want to do because there is some red tape at mass general and with the government in general too. It has been hard to request for that kind of ease and here is a gift card, and we are working towards it but for now we are still working through the echeck system so Mary and Nomin who we are also working with will also be in touch with you all. Some of you we already have your information but if we don’t we will reach out for the name, address, and social and that we can get that check to you, but it will take a minute. A month sometimes because it’s got to go through the counting folks, it gotta...I know, I am so sorry. That is why I am coming off real apologetic right now. I think Mary can speak to it since she.

1:56:53
Timothy: why would an echeck be mailed?
Tony: I don’t even know
Timothy: I thought echeck is something that would show up on your phone.
Nadine: exactly
Tony: I don’t know if I want to call it echeck anymore
Mary: Sometimes they require like signature...I feel like it is echeck because you submit it online
Tony: we are working in the background...yeah no it is cool it is kind of a dumb name

1:57:27
Cynthia: y’all do the clinic card as well. Is this specific research thing no connected to
Tony: I will say that in the world of research sometimes it is like rolling the dice. When I say rolling the dice, I mean, so when out team was putting this project through or any project through we have to go through a review board and sometimes you get a person who is like yeah you can do a credit card gift card, and sometimes they are just like no, we know none of that business and technically we are not allowed too especially if it is over 250. There is just these rules and they, some people put their foot down and some people won’t... it is sometimes the roll of the dice and so as far as our, when we rolled the dice we did not get that but we are still fighting for it. I just wanted to apologies cuz it can be confusing where as some studies do offer that kind of. Honestly like

1:58:31
Nadine: and some offer a regular paper check. They just do the same thing you fill out the information and everything.
Mary: do they give it to you right then and there?
Nadine: they give you a check and it is usually only a week or two weeks
Mike: look at it this way. One day you are going to get a check in the mail that you are not expecting and you will be like wow.
Nadine: And that will be on my

1:59:12
Cynthia: next time kind of make it known where the in person meeting is going to be I know y’all did not expect me to be here today, but I did show up. I was actually and I passed right by you all
Tony: oh no
Cynthia: but I did not know here you all where at, so I mean I could not just have came in person and I did not want to interrupt and ask where are you all at, and so
Tony: that is on us

1:59:39
Mike: Cynthia we have food for you.
Tony: yeah you want to come back
Cynthia: I needed to come home and have some pretzels
Tony: Oh no
Cynthia: and while I was on the line, as Talya mentioned, I did download that app and then I checked the pretzels that I was eating and then they were like
Tony: on my God

1:59:54
Tony: well hey next time we hang out the meal is on me. I appreciate that. Thanks again y’all feel free to hop off or hang out we will just be cleaning up and all that jazz

2:00:08
Cynthia: blessings to everyone and have a great day.
Tony: thank you so much

We had a REAL really good conversation about what he wanted to do and more importantly why he wanted to do it. And so I said okay I’ll help you do that because I believe in what he is trying to do. As we were chit chatting I grew up in this neighborhood. I won’t tell anymore war stories or I’ll get in trouble but I work for mass gen brigham.

[ TVP introducing rules ]

[ 15:36 ]

005:
Theresa A:  Hi I’m [name]. I have had chronic pain for years. My chronic pain was in my back. I could go to my doctor. Pain doctor. I would tell him the pain. Where it was. Faithfully every two and half, 3 months I’m getting 6 numbing needles and 6 needles for the medicine. And he did this for close to 5 years. And the pain wasn’t getting better. I was telling him, I need an MRI. I need you to check this out. And he would not do it. I finally got one. He sent me to the surgeon and within two weeks I had 1-5 lumbar 3,4, and 5 infusions in my back. This is in March. So my issue my problem is all these years that this doctor was shooting me up with all these medications. He knew that it wasn’t helping me. But in my mind I didn’t know that. But all those years he should have did something different for my back. I’m seeing that some of these doctors are giving medications, not to help you but for the finance piece of it.

[ group agreeing ]

[ 17:15 ]

005:
Theresa: During this time, I would be frustrated all the time because I’m always in pain. I was snapping, people were calling me names, because I was snapping, the pain absolutely changed my personality and how I do things.

Should I go next?

Someone else: Yeah. I have a question for her. So when you had the surgery, how?

005:
Theresa: The surgery did help, however. I think I may have moved a little too quickly and doing things because I'm so dumb and independent. I can't sit still. still so possibly I pulled something and I my doctor talked to him back in July they can't get me into the end of August the surgery can't get me back into the end of August so yeah it's painful right now

Selma: May I ask what hospital you go to?

005:
Vicky: Brigham and Women. for both for, for Chesnut Hill is where they was giving me all those injections, pain management. And the operation took place at Francis Street. Excellent surgeon.

Sarah Williams/013: I believe he was. [name] I was diagnosed with lupus at the time. the age of 42, a very scary disease because they couldn't tell me why I had it. It started out with just a little spot on my scalp. I thought that I had it. I was in the process of having it. just got back. But anyway, I think back in 1998, they said, you know, that the little spot was, the lupus on the scale. And from there, you know, just, you know, I had been going to Brigham's and Women. I took that notice. you know, I had arthritis, something, you know, big old thing around the side of my neck. I was working over here at Jamaica Plain High School. So it was a very stressful time, I mean, of course, it was also stressful in my home. I was a foster mother. I had seven foster kids. And I was mad at the time. But anyway, I had to end up leaving my job because the stress was just too much. And then she put me on Prozac. So I was on Prozac for like 20 -some years. you know, along with the lupus come arthritis  so, you know, to me, chronic pain is a pain that don't go away. They give you some medicine,

[ group guesses medication Motrin]

[ 21:30 ]

Sarah W: Yeah, 800 milligrams, yeah. it would last, you know, for a while. But every morning when I, you know, like, in the next morning, the pain is right back again. And then I noticed that it was getting worse. Some days I couldn't even get out of the bed, you know, because I was just in too much pain. And then, you know, I went to bed. I tried to do the best I could but it was all in my fingers, my fingers were swelling up, my toes were swelling up and I just didn't understand it but I was still going back and forth back then I was put on disability. So I had to deal with that. But just not knowing it, I just didn't understand it. went to some you know Lucas meetings at Regulus Center and you know you see people all twisted up with arthritis and you know then they started telling us to go to Dorchester to the Dorchester health Center I think it was and then we had another lady named Doty that was scared of the lupus,  I think she is dead now. it was then I don't know, I was just going to the meetings, just seeing, you know, like the after -effect, people and pain, complaining and overweight I just stopped going because I didn't feel like that wasn't helping me. so I ended up becoming a couch potato, you know, on the couch, oh, it was me. me. So I had to go through that, I went through that, you know, for a time. But then, you know, after going back and forth, I had to end up having a knee surgery. That was the worst thing ever. They was trying to get the other knee if I would let them. So, but I ended up, you know, going, started going to the water aerobics, and trying to get some exercise. and that helped me a whole lot.

Did the pain fall?

Unknown: Yeah, it was, but you know... When it healed up, did the heal put it? Did you feel the pain in you? I was, to me, it took like three, three to four years to heal.

Sarah: So they said it was close to healed. You know, you're down now in six months. But I still get sore in that knee, you know. I got a total knee surgery, so I refuse. I don't want to get the other one, so that's why I go to exercise every day. And I see that I'm going to be there.

Vicky: Yeah, I wanted to add with that because I'm from Georgia, but I moved up here when I was 20, 21 years old. Okay. and I was working. And I came down, first they told me I had the gout. Then after so many tests, they came out, I was in so much pain, especially with my legs. I ended up, I have lupus, systematic lupus. And I've been going through that, but then on top of the lupus with the rheumatoid of the writers and the fibromyalgia. fibromyalgia, I came down with the COPD and I never smoked. And I had the knee surgery too. I had to have it. I was in the hospital for three months because I went into a congested heart failure. I'm still having, that's five years, seven years ago. And I'm still, I haven't been able to get back I'm still. in a lot of pain. I take, Dilaudid, Oxocotin, none of this medicine is doing me any good. I'm (methotrexate) for the lupus. I'm on ( celebrates ) for the lupus. Nothing is helping the lupus pain, nothing has happened. - That's where I'm here. - And I can't get around. I might look like a hundred, but I just turned 65. and I'm having such a hard time with getting around. Now, if I make 10 foot footsteps, I go into my heart rate dropped since It’s getting up too high.


Theresa: Who's taking care of you? My blood pressure. Who's taking care of you?
Vicky:  I can't live by myself. My daughter lived with me and she helped and I go too. to, I was going to Tufts, but I left the rheumatology in the heart department at Tufts, and went to Brickerman with me.

Theresa: Do you, are you affiliated with Seniors Central?

Mike: Central Boston elderly services.

Theresa: Yes, Central Boston elderly services, they'll help you. You should contact them. They'll help you. you have mass health. They will pay your daughter to help take care of you. She's considered like a PCA.

Mike: What does PCA stand?

Well on me, I say consider the lawyer. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I know you do But let me just say everyone.

Mike: I'm old -fashioned I hate acronyms. Yeah, say what it is. Because, and I'm gonna give you the example I always use. In my world, MCI stands for mild cognitive impairment.

Teri: Oh. - But the Pukie in them-- - That's the jam. - MCI is Massachusetts Correctional Institution. That's the jam. - Let's do some. In my world, BMC stands for Boston Medical Center.

Mike: Right. - Right. to Pookie and them. Yeah, BMC is Boston Municipal Court So so I'm just saying you say an acronym I'm gonna ask what does that stand for.

Theresa: PCA stands for..

Vicky: Yeah, but I have tried to do the exercises I can't do them. The physical therapist came to my house and she told the doctors, "It couldn't do the physical therapist because it takes too much out of my heart rate."

Theresa: Even, even, okay.

Teri: I was going to say the water, I don't know what it means. What about the water?

Theresa: Well, I never tried to come in. Yeah. Yeah, I've never tried it before.

Everyone talking: All right, so let me say this. You don't have to do weights.

Mike: Because what you've heard is that you should contact Central Boston Elder Services.

Theresa: Yes, you should. Tell them that you want to apply. And you want to apply for services. I think I might even have a phone number for you.

Tony: I can also follow up with the information.

Teri: Let's see about the water aerobics, because it's not high. You don't do it like high.

Mike: So let's do this. Let's do this. Wait, wait, wait. Let's have Tony follow up and send you the information. And email. And Tony, along with that, you got my permission to say that-- hold on a second. Do you need to do one of our quotes? [INTERPOSING VOICES] All right.
When you call, make sure you tell them that Mike Kincade, spell it the way it sounds. 'Cause you're not gonna spell it right anyways.

No, whatever it does. - T -I -N -C -A -T -E. - Ooh, that's so close.

Mike: But anyway. (laughing) No, you wanna know, you wanna say that Mike Kincaid told me to call you.

Theresa: Okay. And they know me. me. All right.

Tony: I've been using that trick.

(laughing)

Mike: They do know me. And if you get a run around, 'cause sometimes it doesn't happen, let's be honest. Then you wanna ask for Nisi Skeens. Write this down. (laughing) Skeens. And when you get Nisi, even if you get Nisi, you definitely want to say, "Mike told me to call you."

(unknown): Okay. Well, I just want to finish and say that after taking that hydrochloric treatment for about 30 years, and I went to the eye doctor, and the eye doctor said, told me, "Don't take that medicine no more, so we can see, you know, we can see something dark behind your eye. See if your doctor can prescribe you something else. So I went back to her and I told her what the eye doctor said, and then she, you know, I told her I had, you know, stopped taking to the, what's that other stuff, that Prozac, because it has you, you know, you know, you don't have no energy and stuff.

(unknown): So, um, that's all going on now. uh, like in ibuprofen 800 ibuprofen, uh, it gave me a slurry. It ate up my stomach.

Vicky: I can't take that because I take too much of it.

(unknown): People in the black community, uh, and they know, especially from 800, they've messed their stomachs up, but you don't know it until much later.

Sarah: That's the way it is. I think that's what I'm going to do now. but anyway, but anyway, now she, you know, I'm not on any medicine for lupus, she gives me Tylenol for pain, and I have to go to the water a little bit, because if I sit around my body locks up, and I'm back into pain all over again, so that's why I break my neck to try to run every day, but anyway, but anyway, I'm back into pain all over again, so that's why I break my neck to try to run every day, so that's why I break my neck to try to run every day it. I don't have no energy, you know, my energy is short. So I'm still low in energy. She gave my doctor, well, they gave me iron pills. But now she says she wants to do some other tests because with the iron pills I am still anemic. I'm still in need of it. And they feel like I have a bleeding somewhere on my side now. So that's what I'm saying, you know, all day after going up, I feel like I have a bleeding somewhere on my side. you know, picking all that mess and all you want to hear, you know, I always had a handful of pills to pick. Whatever you tell them, I told them one time, "Feel like I have something, feel like something, push it up in my chest." She gave me another pill. It's a pill. They took it out the market and I said, "Wow." I said, "Take that pill." You know, it was for, like, energizing or something like that. That was amazing. it Zantec? Yeah, Zantec. Oh, yeah, Zantec. Zantec, look at this, Zantec Oh, yeah.

Tony: Hi, Ms. Janelle, can you hear me? I just wanted to say, you might want to rejoin again because my Zoom is still in the basic mode.

Tony: Can you hear that? I already heard the 45 minute mark. Yeah. Yeah, I can. All right, so I'm just gonna close this and remake it, but you'll be right back in, okay? No, no This is

Mike: I'm about to make a shameless pitch for research because that's my job But we've all heard about what happened with index what actually happened with this But before a drug goes on the market. They have clinical trials Yeah, but here I'm gonna be real certain group of folks don't participate in research us I means that drug is still going to come out. But they don't know how it will affect us. How it's going to affect black people, Asians, people from the Middle East, and Native Americans. Traditionally, we don't participate in research, but when the drug comes out and starts having negative effects, they pull it, which is why I always tell folks and some of you may have heard me say this before you want to be there at the beginning not when it starts causing problems there's. Another drug I don't know if anybody saw the story but there's a diabetic drug out there I can't remember the name but it's but people also use it for weight loss. Ozempic, that's the one Judy was talking about. They're stomachs, it's called what they call a stomach freeze, paralysis. Well, guess what, that drug wasn't intended to be for weight loss, but it's been used for something else. So when they were doing the clinical trial, guess what they probably weren't looking at?

Weight loss, so don't be surprised. If all of a sudden, that drug disappears up here because they needed they need to go back  and fix. Which is another reason why Participating in research is important because as some of you've heard me say this now Do you remember the old commercial you can pay me now, or you can pay me later.

Yeah,

Mike: but you one way the other the drug is gonna come out your doctor's gonna write you a prescription for it, and then they're gonna discover When enough black people take it. Oh, this is a side effect. Yes inside So, okay, that's my little you ready?

Tony: Also, I just wanted to give anyone here who hasn't talked yet. Feel free in it. You miss Jenna.

Nadine:  So I had a right knee replacement. I'm supposed to have a left knee replacement but it was cancer because my blood sugars were too high. So the other pain that I have is mainly a back pain beside the knees. It's back pain and now sometimes in my ankles. So I did all the tests unfortunately. I didn't have rheumatoid arthritis. I don't have lupus. You know so it's just basically the wear and tear just because my age. But my issue is, even if I try to tolerate the pain by just taking Tylenol or Advil, it's the thought of having to do something when I'm having the pain. So like if I sit too long, like when I get ready to go up, yeah, I probably have to do it in two frames, you know. I'll get stiff. So if I say, oh, I have to go wash the dishes or I need to go outside on the porch, it's just the thought of getting up to walk there, oh I don’t want to do it. Because so for me, it's like, I can try to feel the pain, do that, but it just deters me from wanting to do more because the pain is there.

Tony: I think that'll be a good thing we're going to tap into as well because that's a vicious cycle.

Teri: The mental thing of it.

Nadine: yeah. - And then they gave me lidocaine patches. Uh -huh. So, which was absolutely of no use. So, I went back to. Thought she was all used to the lidocaine patches, how the patches work, and I said, They don't.


(unknown, Sandra?) I'm alone, how can I, I can't even put the patch on, 'cause I can't even reach back. You guys have a meeting, why don't you suggest to one of these companies to figure out how people will live alone can apply the patch in their back. Because I can't even reach, I don't have the range of motion to read for it. So those are my issues, you know. But when it comes to the medication, not related to pain, but that metformin is another medication. Yes. I suffered for like 10 years, 15 years, and just found out within the past year and a half. that all of my GI problems were all related to the metformin. I mean, I didn't even think it was the metformin, but my PCP, the nurse, none of them did either. And then they wanted to push it on me. I actually had to get into a verbal, I won't say altercation, but I had to get allowed with the PCP because she's like, no, you need to take it, you need to have it. it. I'm gonna prescribe it for you. And I said, well, if you have someone who's allergic to bananas, would you have to eat bananas just because it's good for your potassium? She goes, I get it, I get it. She got really mad. So they stopped it. And then with that ozempic, I took the ozempic as a replacement and ended up with pancreatitis. Hope you know anybody who's on the ozempic tell them to watch out for their pancreatitis. I know. In terms of the pain, like I said for me, it's more mental, just the thought of having to get up and move. I like that. That's a good point.

Dorothy: My story is, I had surgery.

Tony: Could you just say your name again for the microphone too?

010: [name]

Dorothy: I had surgery six years ago, or seven years ago, on my right knee. And I've been having problems with it. Then he said that I had lupus. But they never tested me for lupus when I was in front. They said, no, I mean, just after like weeks that I could not walk. And now--

(unknown) How does lupus affect your leg?

(unknown) You don't work the same. Your knee is not the same once we have that surgery. I cannot bend down on my knee. I can't get on the floor. It don't work like it used to work.

Vicky: Mm. I think it's the pain because my pain started in my feet when I got diagnosed with the lupus. and they ran all the different tests and then it came up I had the gout instead of the lupus and they ran all the different tests and then it came up I had the lupus and they before

(unknown): a couple of weeks ago, walking across the street, and this knee gave . I mean, couldn't walk. I had to go back to the pain. The pain is really bad. I still have arthritis to right now.

Teri: And that's the one you had to surgery on?

(Unknown): it never stopped hurting, never. And I kept going back and saying, well, the fiber was good. That's the part I've seen, you know, they took out your, but it was a lot of still hurting. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Now I can't walk again. You know, I don't understand it. I know I have arthritis and stuff, and this knee has swollen up.

Theresa: Now you get a second opinion. You don't have to say you're adopting to the second opinion. I went from BNC to Boston Medical.

(laughing)

(unknown) I don't know, I had the surgery done at BMC say? (laughing) I have to surgery you done at BMC.

(laughing)

I mean, I'm dropping the phone. At a percentile. Mass. Mass health and what it is now. Mass health.

(unknown): Yeah. And then I changed over because it was having so much problems the people was-- even during COVID, checked the knee. He said, oh, the hardware is good. Why’s my legs still hurting after seven years? I don't understand it. I mean, just now, I was walking fine. Well, all of a sudden. a sudden--

Teri: Sometimes the body rejects that stuff, because it's foreign objects in your body. So you don't have to be like whatever, and it don't matter. Because your body's like, no, we don't want this in here, and we're disagreeing with that.

(unknown): I said that, and they just don't want me to suit them. Because after seven years, my niece, like she said, they want to do the other one, I refused it. That's why I said, I want to go to another hospital and get a second opinion. 'Cause there's other hospitals you can go to. You don't have to be going to the same month all the time, all the time. That's why I suggest the room in the Brigham and women's. Maybe the Brigham and women's. is good. I'll tell you the truth, I don't tell my daughter, I don't want to go to Brigham and women's dead and I mean that, but I'm serious.

Mike; You're not the first one to tell me that.

No. - But they've been in one of the top two. - Well, for certain things, for certain things. - Awesome.

I thought Beth Israel, I thought they would be on top, but I didn't have some bad experience in my days.

Tony: And would y 'all also share any experiences you might want to talk about or have everyone here understand just for us to--

Selma:  I had a knee replacement four years ago and I attended at Beth Israel Hospital, but I was walking like this, right, because my back was hurting. Okay. And they were telling me like for years that the reason why my back was hurting, because I'm favoring this knee and it's whatever, okay? Well, my knee doesn't hurt now, but my back still does. They finally said I had stenosis of the spine. And the pain doctor I had, he gave me, he was giving me the cortisone shot, and only one time that I had cortisone in my back that worked. And he didn't do it. the guy that was the assistant or something but he's moved way out to Michigan and somewhere and he's not around and the last time I had this two shots when he decided my back the same day and then I went back again didn't do nothing so when we scheduled the last time I said no I says I'm not doing it because it doesn't do anything it still hurts so we said the only thing I can suggest is surgery I said well at 80 years old I said I'm not gonna have no surgery this is crazy. So he said well he says he says you know in any way I'm not taking a lot of meds and I don't have a lot of health conditions I still could have the surgery. So I said to myself I said well it doesn't hurt to see what this surgeon's gonna say. So I did. I went with my doctor. I went with my daughter right so my daughter was happy as a pig of the shit right because you can tell me this forever right. Dr. says, Ms. Johnson, I looked at the MRIs. I looked at that. You have stenosis, right? And you don't need an operation. What you do, what you need, she says, it's you need to walk. It's arthritis of the spine, that's what stenosis is. What you need is to lubricate them joint. You need to walk. You need to walk at least 20 minutes a day. And my daughter, oh, I told you, she was so happy. I've been telling my mother this for 10 years. You've got to pop across the-- the street. She just went on. - Yeah,

Teri: 'cause a body in motion stays in motion.

Selma: You have to move your body back. - And that's the main thing, but it's hard when you, like you said, it's hard when you hurt. You just think about like getting up to do something. Oh boy, and from last week, I must have pulled something in my back on this side. So I finally went to the doctor yesterday. She gave me some pain pills and muscle relaxers and his patch. patched and I'm not doing no good. Okay. And last night, this side don't hurt now, but this side does. Pain? So, yeah. So I'm just gonna have to just continue to do my exercise. I did this great program with National Hospital. It's called the HELL program. In fact, Tony is my, it was my HELL buddy. And I actually was the coordinator and organizer of all this stuff to get the people involved with my church and the 18 of us. It was an excellent, it was excellent. So we're hoping to do one in September or sometime in the fall, another one. So Tony's around, so I'll give him the information if you guys are interested 'cause the church is open to the public.

Teri: What does that consist of?

Selma: This. It consists of a complete exercise program because I took the book that they give you a book about this thick and I took that book to my therapist and she's like I love it.
I love it. She says if you do this program again let me know. She said because I have so many people in Dorchester and Roxbury and what not that can use this program. It's complete. We went three days a week. We met for an hour and a half usually from 12 to 1:30. let me wait, the latest time of the day was like 2:30. But the first half an hour we went through the book, we exercised the exercises in the books. And then we did exercises starting with, we caught warm -up, we did aerobic exercises, they gave us a weight and we also did the stretching band. And after when I left there every day, every three times in a week, I felt like it. run around and do a lot. But then they had a 12 -week program.

Selma: The first week was in person, right? Then they had a 12 -week person, but we had to be able to use the computer or your phone. And what they were trying to do on the 12 weeks was to see how well you did exercising on your own without the physical one -on -one trainer that we had two excellent trainers. trainers, one was a male and one was a female. And we're talking, we're getting ready to meet with them again to talk about, you know, the next, how we're going to do the next session. But it's excellent.

Tony: And that reminds me, I'm going to ask everyone, you know, if you want to exchange contact information, go for it after this. Because I think part of this is also building community.

Theresa?: You will be an excellent candidate for... the water aerobics.

Theresa? :Oh yeah, you should take water aerobics, you know? - You should consider it, because everything you said that you mentioned in the exercise that you're doing, everything, we do that in the water and you don't feel like taking it.

Yeah, we do that in the water for a while.

Selma: Yeah, that's why I should go with Bruno. In fact, I go up with Bruno.

Yeah, because you don't feel it as much in the water.

No, I don't want to taste it when I'm on a limb. on vacation. We just did it. - Yeah, I know. - Your age, I don't know. -

I was doing it up until I had my new replacement, having that, 'cause then COVID sent it.

What day is the water over this time?

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

At what time?

11.

And isn't it free?

Oh, okay.

If you're a member it is

Teri: Oh, okay, 'cause I know I've seen some things 'cause I'm part of different other organizations and they send off flyers with different things that have it for free for seniors or free for whatever. I didn't read the whole thing that you may have to be a member or anything, but a lot of these things that you can get into are free and also too. So people that know that beyond their zones with me also line dancing is good too and it's good for your memory because people just think of line dancing just a couple of things they see at a wedding or whatever, but this is thousands and thousands of line dances. We have conventions and everything with thousands of people, or whatever. We have a lot of people that are like in their 70s, 80s or whatever that be on their floor getting it.

Teri: Some of them even you see people with braces or whatever gains they don't care. Nothing stop us because that remembering the dances and also moving helps in their music is therapy anyway You start like whatever and in some time the people me don't forgot that game over there be that because For real and people like where's my game like you didn't need in a minute ago when you was on that dance No for real so even that not trying to tell people come to line dance class to at your own rate or whatever And once you start feeling that music and you be like, okay I could do that. Yeah behind you stop, you know, whatever the next thing, you know I'm like, oh, sure. So all that stuff is good, it's good for your memory, too. You know, people that, you know, all times just remember the steps, remember the dances, remembering all that stuff. So, yeah, and our classes are free, too. And there's classes all the time, you know, up in High Park and Zazz, and that's from six to 10, you know, and then Wednesday in Bivs, and they have it at the park, up on the hill. every Wednesday, you know, so there's a lot of things in the community that you can do for free. That's good for sorry, good for your mind and your body, you know, because the type of work excuse me that I do, I do wait staff and that's a banquet server and stuff.

Teri: I'm on my feet all the time and then we're lifting them heavy trays and stuff like that. So a lot of us, we have plantar fasciitis. Yeah, it is on the our back, so whatever, but it's part of the business because we're on our feet all the time and lifting it, whatever, and that pain ain't nothing nice. You know, ain't nothing nice, but you know, I'm not a medicine person. And so I'm using those icy hots and the pain creams and the bio freeze and all that stuff. But I also wanted to ask, has anybody, 'cause I've heard good things about it, like the THC lotions, the marijuana lotions, and stuff like that, that you can get medically prescribed with the THC and stuff, lotion and stuff, and I heard it works pretty good. So I don't know if Tony or Mike can, you know, elaborate on that, but I know some elderly people that they swear by that. They be like, "Nope, I gotta go get my THC lotion or my whatever." So... you don't have a new tire or anything? No. No. I got some. THC is not what the one is it in the middle is it in the CVD?

Tony: The CVD or THC. Yeah it doesn't have the THC. Sorry CVD. THC. No it doesn't get you high.

Teri: No. You're not ingesting. You're not ingesting. You put it on your body. That's why people have medical cards. Because even the gummies and stuff like that too, whereas you know you take them or whatever with just the CVD or whatever. whatever and stuff it relaxes your muscles and think that's a so you a lot of the elderly people have the medical cards and they get their gummies and their lotions and all that stuff because it helps it helps

Mike: so since my name was in both I'm going to say, if there's something out there that you think will help you and it works, try it. Yeah. So that is my professional opinion.

This provides it to me.

Teri: Yeah, no. Because even smoking, some of them, they have certain, they have certain like, just like with anything like you have the Tylenol with 200 milligram, this milligram. It's the same thing with the marijuana. Marijuana. They can prescribe you something that's very low base or whatever, 'cause some people smoke for like, you know, with, for their eye fingers up and it takes them off like the other medications that they used to take, for real. You know what I'm saying? You ain't gonna be saying oh, high or whatever, but it's something that's gonna relax your body, relax your muscles and whatever, and you can do stuff instead of like she said, they'll be in a couch for dinner, can't move over. whatever, you know?

Mike: Let me just say this, if you go into a dispensary, they do have folks there that are trained to answer your questions. So if you're looking for a particular type of gummy, if you're looking for a particular type of ornament, I mean, ointment, not like ointment, yeah. They can guide you. you. But something I just realized is listening to folks and so what I'm going to challenge folks to do and tell them I'm going to make you the spot on this is if you know of things that are happening in the community, send it to Tony. He'll put together a resource list. You know who, what, all that and especially if it's free. If you know of things that are happening. like Saturday mornings up at the golf course, they do free yoga.

Yeah, yeah.

Mike: Believe it, nine o 'clock in the morning, nine or 10 o 'clock in the morning. - And they have a walking club. - And they have a walking club. So, send Tony this stuff, and then so he can put it together and then send it out.

Teri: MGE does a walking thing too, a wreath up.

Yep.

For this lady.

Jennell: And you know, the Madison school, that they are not allowed to have, has some, free water robes.

Mmm, okay. Who's that? Madison. Madison Park High School. I did not know that. So believe it or not, I was mentally free water robes.

Wait, let's say it again. Free water robes. Monday through Friday

Jennell: I'm not sure what day. Where? Madison. Madison Park High School. The call we were calling with the UCB, uh, Ms. Curry mentioned it. it. And I think Joni was on at the same time when we were talking about that.

Hmm. It's amazing school right down there on Magazine Street.

Mike: Yeah, 'cause I'm sitting here mentally driving up and down Blue Hill Lab, trying to think of how many places have swimming pool.

Yeah, and most of them have things to do.

No, most of them are specific.

Mike: Most of them, 'cause the only two that popped in my mind, and I did not think about Madison Park was Roxbury why yeah but she just said it's it's a no she said the maison  school but we keep talking that we can't hear it say it again The show wants them to have a pool.

Jennell: Outdoors. But this is inside. And they have somebody in there. These are indoors. They do seniors want to vote. But they also have to know Dancers are also aware that they I think you pay two dollars for seniors.

Theresa?: And you can go to the Crocs Center. I believe they can have one of those. That's right. The Crocs Center has a case. But listen. The Crocs Center is going to hate to say sucky. sucky lately, because they send me e -mails, they keep canceling everything.

Oh.

I don't know why all that stuff's been canceled.

They had a problem with the water for a while, so they had to empty the pool, have it refilled, and it took some time.

Okay, so I know exercise, cheer, roll base, you know.

Tony: And I just wanted to pivot, just to give space for others who haven't talked yet, if anyone wants to chime in, no pressure.

011:

Sandra:  I'll say something. something. Yeah. I'm [name]. My issues probably started in my 40s. I got GERD or acid reflux. So they prescribed Zantac and I probably took it for close to 20 years because if I didn't take it, you know, the food would feel like it was coming up. I'd get sick and throw up at night. Come to find out, I heard on the TV that it was coming up. causing cancer. So I stopped taking that. I go back to the doctor. She never notified me to stop taking it. I did it on my own because I wasn't waiting to see if she was going to do it. So then they put me on Prilosec, which was excellent. It stopped the acid reflux. But what they didn't know at the time was that it keeps your bones from absorbing, and it keeps your bones from absorbing. calcium. So I ended up with osteoporosis because of that. My bones got brittle. I've had bone breaks, lost a lot of bone density. So now I have to get shots every, after I get an infusion now. Every three months it started out. Every month I got an infusion to help to keep the calcium in the bones that I had left and I have to take extra calcium now. So that was one issue. But the end result is that I had osteoporosis and I can't do the things I like to do. Working in the garden, I want to go out and pull weeds, plant my plants or whatever. But the bending over bothers my back and then I get real severe pain and then have to take medicine for that. So I advise people, I've had a couple of nieces that said they have it. as a reflux and they're going to take (medicine) I said don't take it.

(unknown): Can I just say something? Most of us have these phones, right? When the doctor gives you a prescription or tells you something, you should go in and look it up. Oh, I did that all the time. This information is there and nothing. Then if you have questions, like you have your little notebook when you owe your doctor, and you've got to write things down. You've got to write things down that you want to tell her when you go to the doctor. doctor and also when she tells you something you should write it down so you can remember it.

(unknown): About two years ago I fell in the out of plane with my great grandson because he wanted to play ball.

He threw the ball at me. I went to catch it. My foot got caught on something and I fell down and I fractured my femur.

I was in a lot of pain, and I just felt weak after. I wasn't the same. And so I decided to join an exercise class. When I did get well, I went over to the Croc Center because they have exercises for seniors two days a week. I go there and lifting weights, using the bands and everything. Because I used to bowl when I had to stop bowling because I didn't have any strength.

So this past winter, I went back to bowling again at school. But I didn't have any strength. wanted to tell everybody it's good to stay active. I believe in it profoundly because I'm doing line dancing three times a week.

I met Angie from the Ridden Riding and she told me about it and so they go up to Franklin Park and they dance. From Wednesday, yeah. And then she's back to the World Hall Community Center which is free if you want to go on a Thursday afternoon.

And she's excellent because she uses a microphone and explains. everything to you.

The two of you are inspired.

Is that what you call school incentives?

Yeah, they're right next to the library.

I was getting ready to mention that when she finished.

I love the senior center.

Yeah, because they be doing stuff in the seniors every day, you know, and they walk around, they have their little weights and all that kind of stuff.

There's not the place where they take people and look at them.

Next to the chair.

No. Next to the Jerry.

No, it's next to the library.

Yeah. Next to the Jerry.

No, it's next to the big Jerry. Go find it. Yeah, the back of the burq. Yeah. On the right hand side is the library. Yeah. The left hand side is the burq. It's in the middle. It's 50 Geneva. Yeah. 50 Geneva.

Yeah. And they give free lunches to the seniors. I heard it. Yeah. I've been there. Yeah. I've been there. (group chattering) But I can't stress enough that doing some type of exercise, even if you're at home doing it, because before I found a place to go, I used to lift weights and stuff, trying to just build up my self -agent. I'd just like her on couch, the table, just sitting at home all the time, and my granddaughter's just trying to, "Nana, come on, do stuff." stuff. But I had problems with my back too. And it's like my shoulders, my back, my neck. And I was like her, they found all these problems with the L5 and the L5 on my spine. And then they said I had sciatica. Then they gave me back surgery.

Supposed to be straightening it out. Now I can't even bend over to do my shoes. And so I never talked about it. my shoelaces. I never tie my shoelaces. I just have my or I have my slip on shoes and stuff.

So in the winter, I don't know what I'm gonna do. But the Lidocaine patches helped me some. And I went and I got a waste drink.

I was gonna say, or even two, but you know the ones that the guys use when they have have them jobs, when they lift heavy stuff, that thing, and it has the straps, too, the kind of support you need. I think you know the waste trainer, and then, so then the waste trainer, it got to the point where that wasn't helping at all, so then, now I got a, no, it's not a back brace, it's a, you know, it's not a back brace, it's a, you know, it's not a back brace, it's a, I want to say girl, but don't hit me. It's almost like a girl. It's kind of like a waist trainer, but more thicker.

Yeah. Yeah, so that one of those... And you think they support. They don't matter what it is. Yeah, so it's hard for me to snap it and stuff like that, but I figure it out. And then, like, sometimes when I'm walking, my knees just, my legs just give out. out and so I've got to go sit down somewhere and stuff like that so I'm just like to start doing exercises and stuff like that that's what I need to start doing that's why I love going to the senior center because it gets me out to do all kinds of stuff and this is all that you need to have.

It's right on Geneva. It's right on Geneva. It's right on Geneva. Remember where the bubble used to be in that parking? parking lot if you're Okay, you know where the mosque is the mosque right here the job is over the Mohammed's mom. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait Wait, wait, wait. All right, you know, we're stopping shop.

Yeah. All right There's two entrances to get into them all. There's one that's right off the warren And then the other entrance that's on the the Geneva F, you're going to the library there, you're going the wrong way,

You have the power on, right there too. I'm just gonna, sorry, I just wanted to jump in. I know that it's already two, but I was just curious, are people interested in continuing to talk? 'Cause there's some other stuff I was hoping to ask, but only with permission.

This is good, this is good. Okay, all right, if everyone's happy with it. I guess I also, before I pivot, I also wanted to give, again, just other, people who haven't had a chance to say hi miss janelle did you want to share oh okay well i appreciate you coming though okay and can you call me when you get through with the class oh yeah absolutely i'll give you some more details too thank you for coming coming

I want to come just to participate you know you don't need to get the card and nothing like that I just want you to come to participate or this will help yeah that's like the appointment that's on the patches And then my pain gets real.

Is that the CBD one? No. Okay. Is that a mannequin? Oh, okay. It's a mannequin, Mike. So you have to have a description.

Oh, okay. Oh, I get that. Okay, she's such a kid. The mannequins are great. 'Cause Mike did follow me sometimes. I don't really know how this goes with that. Yeah, Mike did. It's an idea. I'm just gonna bring everyone back together again, but first of all, this is this is amazing conversation and I think people are talking about so many important subjects, you know, whether it's like staying active.

Trying to get yourself into a mindset where you're helping your body and doing things instead of feeling kind of down and Sort of avoiding movement and motion and then I also see that sometimes Having community and having people to share ideas with is really important when it comes to figuring out answers that work.

TVP: And so I want to jump gears to touch on some of the things that we were already talking about if anyone needs to go go, don't feel tied down because I'm just thankful to have everyone here. But you know, part of the work that Mr. Kincade and I are doing is turning this known, sorry, mind -body intervention for people from underserved communities. And so right now, older black Americans. And I wanted to bring up some of the key components of these therapies because I wanted to get just feedback as far as what you or what you think other Black Americans might think of them and feel free to be negative or positive because right now you know we're we're wanting to learn even if that means
 changing things so you know when someone say maybe like a provider says to you I want you to go Take this class in mindfulness based cognitive therapy or some kind of mind -body intervention And you go there and they start asking you to do things like Meditation Yoga mindfulness What does that mean to you and what are your thoughts when? someone asks you to do that? Are you excited or confused?

I get excited about the meditation because it relaxes you so much and at night I don't sleep at all because I'm always in so much pain.

So I went to UCB, they did meditation, but they only did it like 10 minutes. so I didn't really get to learn a lot of the process and everything like that but with that the first couple of weeks when I when I did do it it was like I slept during the night it was just so good for me.

You don't go on MJE? You don't go on the MJE the health and wellness thing they do that yoga and all that stuff all the time with the meditation. and yoga Okay, sorry Mother's the justice and equality Yeah meetings outside.

This year, I got nothing. Because they still do the health and wellness and the yoga and all that stuff. I see it, but I can't get into it. So what you're going to do is you're going to send Tony the link. Okay.

Send Tony the information. Okay, yeah. They send you the link and everything. Yeah, but every time I try to get into it for some reason, I can't get into it. I don't get into any other meetings and stuff like that, but I can't get into those. Yeah, I know because they have the health and wellness and the yoga and all that stuff. lady comes and she does the thing, you know, you sit in the chair and you do all that kind of like, yeah, I try to get into it.

Do I have your email? I'm actually gonna, I'm gonna ask for a piece of paper, I'm gonna have everyone kind of write their name down and their contact information. I don't know, I'm gonna get in and I'm gonna ask for a piece of paper.

I think the next thing I wanted to bring up is some of these things that we'd like to almost think critically about in regards to these key components so you know one thing we're hearing is like there is certainly demand for it but how can we make them better and sorry I uh I know that from talking with people in the community already as well as reading some of the um the comments and the literature there are some things and so I'm going to bring them up one by one and just feel free to chime in if you think it's like oh that would work well time kind of making this mind -body intervention work better or like or or that wouldn't work well.

TVP: And so one thing that I've heard from people is, you know, we talk about meditation, but the truth of the matter is sometimes meditation has overlap with other things too, like contemplate a prayer. And, you know, obviously not everyone prays, but sometimes praying can help, and praying can also be considered a type of meditation. But what are, what is everyone's thoughts in terms of that? Like if prayer was a part of it?

Most black people don't have problem with the prayer of thoughts, right?

(laughing)

That sounds like next question.

(laughing)

Excellent, by the way.

(laughing)

I think that's how my needs go as well as the ones that say,
"Oh, please help me."

Another theme that I had heard from the community, and even right now, is the idea of things being in the community and free. And so, you know, I'm going to go into maybe some ideas as to how that would work, but just in general, like would people trust a intervention that was delivered in the community and... was free? - What do you mean?

You know, I saw, I'll give an example.

What is the trust?

In certain countries where there's like malaria, people almost like feel like they should pay for malaria nets because they feel like the free ones aren't gonna be like good or something.


Oh, no. Mm -hmm. 'Cause I heard a lot of people say that black people get paid less, on these studies than white people. And I don't know if somebody in this room said that.

No, no, let me say yes, here's the deal. Black people don't get paid. Here's the deal. No, no, no, no, no, no. I've heard that. No, no, no, no. Here's the deal.


Here's the deal. Okay, go ahead. it is is that they have to pay an individual the same amount of money but the problem is that you will hear about study A study B study C different studies but you don't hear about study D now study A B and C may pay you 50 bucks 25 bucks $100 gift card but study D will pay you $1 ,500 now.

There are four different studies It's just the key is they all fall under the all -signals umbrella. So people go What do you mean you're getting $1 ,500 for that all -signal study?

I'm only getting 15. It's gift card And they're like no and so so so that's what I go. They play and I'll be honest study D I've got a dumb or a dumb not as it's just that it has predominantly white people and it's more likely to be, for example, at Madison General Hospital as opposed to the Brigham. So they, and part of the reason that they have to pay you the same amount of money is because in research, you have to study apples to apples.

Yeah. You know, in oranges to oranges, you can't have an apple and a peach because then it's not. an equal study So they have to pay But the problem is is that again, they have As much as all Simon's disease research center, we have 40 freaking studies And none of them are alike. Yeah, and so They all have different criterias. They all do different things and they all pay probably different amounts of money. And that's why, that's why when people have said, "Well, might they pay black people less than they pay white people?" I'm like, "No." They pay them the same amount in the same study, it's just that white people in the studies that pay more. And then also too, sometimes you don't qualify for certain things, and then sometimes people be like, "No, I don't want to do that." So it all depends on what you're willing to do, because I've done like a few with the SLEEP app. and this and that So, you know, sometimes you're gonna go there and so dirty you gotta go to sleep They on your face and then and have all these why is sometimes people are doing all that, you know I mean, so it's like, okay. Well, then you're not gonna get paid the thousand dollars or whatever that they pay I'll take certain medications that might be good for the heart, but they want to see if it's good for sleep apnea I'll do those.

I really don't do too much like with the experimental medication. That's That's not approved for nothing But you know just like their aspirin they found out it was good for heart So just not just for headache. So somebody had to do that study to know what it's to them to know So I'll do things like that. So like some of the sleep apnea pills They know they're good for like just say ADHD or this or that the other they want to see if it's good for sleep apnea But I have to go in a few times, you know, stay overnight have the thing on my face all these these wires all over. And sometimes people don't want to do that, but I'm like, I'm fine, I'm good, I spent the night. You know, $1 ,000, but you know, it's like 100, 150, you know. Whatever, but it is what it is. But they have to pay everybody the same, 'cause they have one piece of paper that says all the things. So they don't just give you a piece of paper and then somebody else a different piece of paper.

I think that in the blood community, a lot of us don't have to pay everybody the same. know about a lot of these studies. That's why it's group studies. You are 200 % correct.

But again, we, a lot of people, you said it's a lot of groups. Sarah is my swimming mate at the Y,ff
 and she introduced me to this. thing. Oh my, oh yeah, cause somebody asked you how did you come to UCB. You know, UCB filled that thing up.

It's a community. Yeah, a community itself. And when people in the community, some of these studies,
 they're paying so low, you know, you can get studies at UCB. - And that's my frustration. And some of you guys don't know me. I cannot tell you how many church basements on a Saturday afternoon,
 I have sat in my lifetime to tell people about this stuff. But the problem is, is that there's not enough people telling folks about these studies.

I try to put information out there, so people know about all these things.

No, no, no, no, I know that. - No, no, no. - Put the bookseed. I mean, where I work, we're starting up this thing now, we're bringing research studies literally out to the community. We did it at New Academy of States, we're getting ready to do it at Mission Maine, we did it at Blue Ledge Co -op. We're bringing these research studies out to the community. Why don't you put it in the other band? on this paper? Because Karen and I have that conversation because the banner basically would be endorsing it.

I know people to ban it. Well, I used to know people to ban it, since anyway. But the point is is-- And what studies, excuse me, are you bringing to the community what was this specific one?

See, the studies that we're bringing out are the studies that you don't have to go into the hospital for. Right. okay.

Now let me say this right off the bat. Is it the study that's gonna pay you $1 ,500?

No.

No, because it's a one. The one and done, you may get 50 bucks.

Yeah.

But the ones where you got a roll in there once a month, whether it's in--

Oh yeah, those are the ones that are--

Those are the ones that are $1,600, $6,000, $7,000.

What about the one with the watch?

Oh, the Fitbit thing, I don't remember. I'm not sure.

I think about a dollar.

Yeah. but hold on but you don't get the grand up front you get the grand yes but everybody with UCB know you know this I am always rolling in there with some researcher talking about their studies because that gets me my biggest bang for the buck because before COVID back in the day you
 know I used to go hang out with the Golden Ears I used to go hang out with the seniors on the move God knows I used to come. I mean, I, again, I have been in more living rooms, basements,
 you name it, talking to five people about something, you know. But the reason why is because those are five people who wanted the information.

So what do you think about the watchman? - I like it, and here's the reason why. I like it because of the fact that it tracks, and I'm gonna circle this back a little, it tracks your activity. That's what it does, it tracks your activity. How much, how many steps you take? You know, I'm not sure if that one actually tracks sleep, but there's some that tracks sleep. But the point is, is it tells you stuff about you, you don't know.

Right. Because, you know.

And sometimes doing research studies, it catches things before it becomes like a problem. Because they're taking your blood, they're doing this, they're doing that. and they tell you like you know what we found in your blood such and such you may want to talk to your primary care about this. But lady I'm gonna circle this back because because if you're well first of all I can't I can't give you a gift card but anytime you want to have this type of a conversation someone just let Tony know I'll show up that's not a question mark you know boy but I'm circling it back to Tony because of the We were talking about the next step and for me that is really exciting Yeah, I can also say that you know as part of a group that mr. Kade and I are part of we there's multiple studies for Older individuals as well. So I'll definitely send those out and I'm gonna fish around and keep y 'all updated updated.

I'm sorry but I have to leave in like five minutes. That's okay honestly if anyone has to go don't worry about it. Because you knew what I told you. Yeah yeah yeah don't worry. I got a question. So like I do the Alzheimer's research time and it's going to be like it's going to go on for years.

So like if I just want to participate? I don't think so. I sort of like yeah yeah said, since I've been doing it because they take the blood and everything like that, I have experienced them catching up with me. And it's kind of like free healthcare.

They have like these people doing those things. If you participate in a research study at Mass General Brigham, you become a patient of Mass General Brigham. If something pops up that they weren't expecting, and you weren't expecting, they will shift you to that department.

Yeah.

So, I mean, it is what it is. - If it's okay, I'll come back to this topic. If anyone has to go, feel free.

I'm doing a stipend.

Oh, yeah, the stipend is definitely some information I'm gonna give right now. So first of all-- - So, I'm gonna scoot, 'cause I gotta go meet my son.

Okay, see you later, honey. honey.

I will see everybody around, and let's keep doing this. - And let us know when you're gonna be doing those pop -up study things or whatever, 'cause I wanna know. - I wanna know too. - 'Cause I try,
 so I,

For everybody at UCB, we are getting ready to do a part of the night, and we're doing a part of the night in October, which we're looking at a study.

We're doing one in November, where we're gonna be looking at preparing for the holidays, and we're gonna be doing a part of the night in October, and we're gonna be doing a part of the night in October, gonna love them with Alzheimer's. And then we're doing one in December on caregiving and taking care of yourself.

So you're gonna be giving that information out on network night? - Yeah. - Okay. - And then Tony and I are popping up at a network night. - Yeah, yeah. And you be on our recovery. - Exactly. - With support to us.

All right.

I know.

I gotta scoot everybody.

All right, thank you.

Thank you Mr. K.

Make sure you get Tony your information.

Yes. Does anyone have any issues with me sharing this with everyone?

I just want to make sure I respect everyone's privacy. So what I'll do is I'll take a picture of this and I'll send it to everyone over text. And then again, if anyone has to go, I just have a few more things.
 Oh, yes, yes, yes. Thank you, ma 'am. Okay, so the stipend is something I'd like everyone to connect with me back on. And I'll just be getting information. on a very basic level including name address phone number which you know most of which I already have the thing that might make people so someone comfortable is a social just because this is going to be via electronic check so I know that can be dicey because some people are you know unfortunately so I'm sorry sorry. Yeah, no, it's a good it's a good thing Some people thought it was a gift card. I Yeah, I Unfortunately cannot Because we pay over $50 they they have a rule that's really strict at MGH We had talked with some folks before and they said we can't allow you to give gift cards I tried to push back and I said what about to give cards and they were like no no no other people have been trying to that too." So unfortunately, the e -check is the only way. So I have apologized. Can you just like your last four digits of your social? You know what I can do is I'm just gonna just, if you're uncomfortable with that, I'll just not put it in and see where it takes us. If they push back, then, you know, I'll get back to you. They want you because because what they do is like if you you don't have to pay taxes up to $600 anything over 600 they send you a W9 at the end of the year Yes, so that's why they need your social keep track of how much money they're paying you because nothing gets past the government Yeah, so if you're doing a study over here study over here, it's under the same thing with partners They calculate like I'll be getting a W9 Because my stuff has been over like a couple of thousand Okay, but it's because they want to track how much money they're giving you over 600 they want you to pay taxes on it so that's why they ask you for your total thank you for explaining I did a study you tell my Britain study from northeastern that's kickstain me asking me I need a W2 from I thought it was a folks yeah no thank you for coming yeah no the government will keep track track of everything you've done.

Everything you've done. I just sent you my information, Tommy. Well, he wasn't done, was he? Oh, it's okay. People gotta go. I mean, it was over at two, technically. Oh, okay. Yeah, so I think when he's gotta go, it's fine. Oh, I'll see how it goes. 'Cause I do have some things I'd like to flesh out, but honestly, people gotta go. Thank you so much for coming.

I really appreciate it. it by the way we'll stay in touch about the site of the stipend sorry again it's not a gift card well we're gonna do it but the electronic check so usually it goes straight to your bank account oh straight to your bank account okay a phone number but also but also-- - And your social.

Yeah, social.

My social share in life, I've never been to my bank account.

Oh, didn't you? I'll have to, so I'm still fleshing it out with the funding that I'm getting it from. If it doesn't go directly, it'll certainly be some kind of--

Well, again, go to our bank, if you don't know our bank account. - True, true. - Listen, now you can talk about your phone number.

Right, right, right.

Oh, okay, I don't know.

I got health, so you can do it too much.

Okay.

Oh, yeah, catch up.

All right, I'll ask the admin.

Yes. 'cause they help me out a lot with that.

Okay, we'll see you at the question, 'cause I want to, 'cause so I got it.

Got it, so there's two other things I was just curious, you know, when it comes to these innovations, and one of them is the idea that instead of a professional, like, you know, I'm a psychiatrist, or a psychologist, or a professional, but a community person who's still trained in these skills almost similarly, to I remember Miss Yvette came to UCB and did like some yoga you know like yeah she's not a psychiatrist but she's someone who worked to deliver this what if we made this sustainable and free by essentially training people in the community people like yourself even to deliver these to other people say in spaces like this you see be no with would that be believable, would people accept that? - And people like that anyway, just like when they have all these psychologists telling you how to raise your kids and this and that and the others, like, do you have any children? No. So how the hell do you wanna tell me, you know what I mean? You just know from a book or whatever, so if you have somebody that's in the community who you can relate to better and whatever, and even if you're like on the sidelines, just you know, whatever, or however the thing, but still, somebody's... you can relate to more mm -hmm it's like okay she's one of us you know what I mean oh he's one of us mm -hmm so yeah I think I mean for me you know I'm one thing that was um connecting with that is my parents only see Vietnamese dogs mm -hmm they and it's not on the racist thing it's just like they get whatever yes they get yeah cuz they know where you're coming from mm -hmm you know when they can understand

Now I think if they were more Black guys, I would go with just Black guys.

Yeah, I have a Black drop room at Madden.

But not a man, not a man, I don't like them.

So they would understand and maybe be empathetic to what I'm telling them to be more willing to listen.

Yeah, and they would just get it. Maybe there's something you don't need to say because they understand your experience.

Yep, they understand before you even say it's like, I already know. know." And then there's other little nitpicky things too. Some of them include the idea of incorporating other aspects into this mind -body intervention.

So the first thing is something I kind of saw which is like even like movement when it comes to like meditation over like knitting, quilting, like little activities like that. Yeah. Are people into that? Yeah. last thing is just the idea of having space for people to talk about even what it means to be black and to have chronic pain and to just deal with it more meetings like this meetings like this but even like during those interventions that were group -based just carving out time for people to just say what they need to say say about that listen I feel like I'm going to see like this Asian doctor this like white doctor so forth and just I'm just feeling like they're not hearing me or something because they don't get my experience and just having time for that is that with that the annoying like a lot of came back I don't even have the range of motion to common sense though right

Right.

So I even fit, I mean, I said, why are you guys drinking that out here? - That's a good point.

Well, that's something with like a stretchy thing that I can just then stretch it over.


Were you about to say something?

One of my friends this week just told me, she had back pain and thermo care makes a back patch that covers your whole back.

Oh, see that's why this is something that comes, you know, pretty complete. Yeah.

Yeah. - Well, everyone's free to hang out and chat, honestly. I'm totally down.

'Cause I think that one of the things I really would like out of this intervention that we're making together is the ability to create spaces for people to connect. Because you're, sometimes, I'm a doctor. I don't have all the answers. When I see people, sometimes they help me. And also, they give me ideas on how to help other people. And I felt, like, just-- listening to y 'all There are so many cool ideas Does anyone want to take some pizza home, I mean I'll eat it I will eat it. I will eat it. By the way, I'm so sorry about that. We appreciate it.

Sometimes, you know, my brain isn't screwed on. Next time, have it delivered. Exactly. Exactly. No, but we appreciate it. Thank you. I tried my best. It's free food, honey.

Thank you, Charlie. Yeah, it's my pleasure. People y 'all have been feeding me. I sent you my information. And I'm going to send everyone else that. I'm going to take a screenshot of that and send it to everyone.


If anybody don't want theirs, type it. Everyone has a ride home. Okay, alright.

Why are you going to put them on your bike, Tony? You know, honestly, I actually... Have them all going all over the place like the pizza. I was doing too much again. I got in a bike accident recently. Oh, look at that.

I got a clue at all. I was going to call y 'all a Uber, I guess.

I do too, but, you guys can take the chips home too. I'm just gonna take it, but I don't really, it's for y 'all.

Oh, absolutely. - Second time here, we'll take them, do you like that? - I will, thank you, Ms. Southerner.

Did you fall and that's what happened to this? - Oh, my sister did that. - Oh, Lord have mercy.
But this, I mean, honestly, I break enough tablets too.

It's a sour cream, anybody want the sour cream? - Yeah. - All right, I'll write it down. - All right, all right, ladies. - That's nice. - Nice meeting you. - We've been here so long.
All right, Tony.

All right, thanks for coming. Yes, Sarah William.

So, Sarah, did you see the email from me?

All right. I didn't, yeah.

Okay, so it's Terry Trockman, okay?

Okay.

So, they should have checked his fan, too, since we're not, whatever, Mike Goldenale, whatever. - I'll send numbers over text, too, just in case.

Okay.

All right.

Sit down right here, please.

Mm -hmm, yeah.

Give her that step, okay?

Yeah, I was talking to Jenelle last night. She's the one that told me about this.

Thank you for coming last minute like that.1

It's interesting, I think I'm gonna--

Did you have fun?

Yeah.

All right.

So she sent me the email, you know, invited me to join.

Okay. - So I sent the information to Jenelle. last night I don't know how long it'll be before I get something back oh you mean for this study I thought it was for this okay I well I I have your number so I'll keep in touch with you I'll send you another text message again and call so we can figure out the stipend too okay but and also actually she said it was the no Thanks for coming Something union capital Yeah, that was it. Oh Okay, that's that's I'm part of union capital

okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's fun We have well, I don't particularly run it, but they they have a lot of community events people get on zoom They have in person -person at the UCB. Have you been to their offices? They have like a meeting space.

It's really cool. And then they have breakout groups and people talk about random stuff. Like there's seniors in power and purpose. Sometimes there's an instructor and she'll just come and do free yoga classes.

Sometimes they talk about healthy aging. I've come there and did talk some kind of pain and just what it means again, like just the... yeah, have healthy activities that foster resilience from things like Alzheimer's and stuff like that.

So I think that if you have any questions to everyone here, I think most people here, I'm at the UCB.

Oh, okay.

Do you, where do you live?

I live right in Dorchester.

Oh, that's perfect. 'Cause they have those events right at the UCB Center. It's right next to Jackson Square. It's like across from... the tea stop. I get off the tea, you know, I just walk right over there. Oh, okay. Mm -hmm. And how are you getting there? I drove.

Oh, you drove? When I got here, I couldn't find any place to park here, so I went down while on an album and had to walk up, but it took me... Do you need someone to walk with you? No, I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. I used to come to another meeting like two or three doors down. Um, one of the organizations... I was working with, elder health care disparities. There's so many interesting groups I needed to learn. Maybe I'll call you sometime and just learn about some of the service groups because I also you know I see a lot of patients from various age groups and they always ask me like oh I gotta get connected with this and that and I'm new here because I'm from Virginia and I yeah I'm just like learning about the service opportunities they have for all the various people around here. One of the groups I belong to is called seniors on the move. Seniors on the move. And there's people in there that were 80, 90 years old. But anyway we meet at the Roxbury Y once a month. But we have guest speakers come in so you might want to go in.

 and talk to some of those people. I'm always looking for presenters. I would be happy to give a short presentation and share some studies. And there's usually, I want to say 75 to 80 people that come to those meetings.

Wow. It's a good crowd. What a good opportunity. Yeah. I'll have to, if it's okay with you, I might send you another text to kind of chit chat so I can write some of those notes down. I'm on their advisory board.

Oh you are? Okay. So you're going to know. You're a good person to know.

I help with the programming and all that, you know.

Okay, all right, I hear that. I'm, you know, one thing that I'm always surprised about but thankful for is just the services that are here in Boston, like coming from the South, it's kinda disjointed at times. - Yeah, everybody says that. My young sister -in -law, who was living in Boston, sold her house and she moved out to Randall.

What? - Mm.

Boston has the ride. ride. - The ride is insane. I never even had a concept for that. - In Randolph, they don't have any ride services. - Yeah.


So she has to pay Uber to come into Boston and go to the hospital.

I mean, people just straight up like, whether it's like Atlanta, North Carolina, Louisiana, Virginia, all those places, they have almost like zero services for seniors. - Mm -hmm. it's actually really bad because I'll be working in a clinic and then they'll call me and say well I couldn't come in because I don't have a car and then I can't walk and all these things and I feel bad but here it's like sometimes they'll call and say I can't make it in and say oh actually I met another senior they said that there's something called a ride and you're disabled so you can well they and Boston actually has a free shuttle if you go into a doctor's appointment but they only run till two o 'clock in the afternoon I didn't know that hmm the more you know I'm one thing that I am it always takes me a minute just to get used to when I'm working on different settings just understanding all the all the ways to help people that are specific to like each area.

How long have you been in Boston?

Not long, I moved here in 2021.

Oh, okay, so wow.

Yeah, well, I moved here during the pandemic, so that also kinda slowed down my understanding of Boston, 'cause I didn't get the opportunity to essentially kinda sit down and meet people in person,
 go to places that were open, and honestly, I didn't get the opportunity to meet people. yeah, just understand what it means to live here. But then things got a little better with COVID, so it's really been taking use, making use of this opportunity to go into spaces like this and meet people and actually hear real stories about what it means to just deal with issues like chronic pain.

Yeah, I hope to go home and make out a list of the different opportunities. organizations that I'm involved with because they're always looking for presenters. Oh, okay.

I am 100 % happy to present because one, I just like meeting people and two, it gives me an opportunity to connect with other people and share with them studies that they could enroll in if they're interested.

And you have a list of differences. different studies? Yeah, I have at least the studies that I'm somewhat connected with. Like a lot of the studies I'm somewhat connected with are about helping seniors with like not just chronic pain but memory issues, sometimes nursing care issues, really about filling the gap in care where sometimes it's not there. because like say you're you just got out of the nursing The skilled nursing facility, and then you weren't ready yet And so how do we fill that gap or sometimes people have fears about aging because Memory problems are you know very common as we get older.

How do we address that? How do we prevent those issues? Yeah, and so I think that basically I Can connect you with those two two. I have actually a PDF and I can send you those and then like I was saying earlier I'm actually going to hunt around a little bit just to see specifically what studies I can find at Master General that could work for everyone here.

Could I give you my email address? Oh yeah actually you want to write it on the back of this? I can email you you all that information, too. I think Ms. Janelle had actually given it to me. But if you write it there, I'll be double sure to get it. Have you heard of mass senior action?

Thank you all seniors, but we what we do is just pick pick a subject that's Important nor there's an issue with That relates to seniors and then we go to City Hall.

We write the yeah yeah, that's fantastic We get bills passed. That's how you do work. That's how you do work And we're doing like one right now for long -term long -term care,
 you know with the Deficiencies that are in long -term And that's what we're talking about - a skilled nursing facility. I always don't want to go to a nursing home Exactly,
 but they don't have a choice and then in Boston. It's a big issue and I don't know if it's like that all over the United States if you put your if you don't put your house in a truck and you go into a nursing home and you end up that you can't pay the 12 ,000 every month because you're not on Medicaid they can put a lien on your house and you they have to sell your house to pay for the nursing home which is
 ridiculous The PCAs don't get paid enough money. There's a shortage, so a lot of people sign up to have, you know, someone come in to the house to help them, but they don't have enough help to do that. And I've even been to one of the--

Do you want any of them?

Yeah, thank you, yeah, thanks.

Yeah.

I've been to one of the union meetings that the PCAs were having, the things that paid enough money. - Oh, of course.

And their biggest issue is, it doesn't get paid enough. they don't drive, they have to take the bus to each patient's house. You don't get paid for the time that you're traveling on the bus. - I see. - You know, it's a big problem in Massachusetts.

At the sun, yeah.

I thought sometimes I'll spend a minute just talking with someone on the streets and yeah, they'll tell me their story about how just via some weird issue with housing and the way that you have to...
 to you know set aside your money and kind of like not get blown apart by XYZ rule when it comes to owning homes like they're homeless and it's it's sad because I think about how could happen pretty much anyone but I'm gonna definitely connect with you because I think that I have a lot to learn learn

 “CH”: Couldn’t Hear
[ chronic pain probe]
Tony: Umm... What the people want.. umm.. So, one other thing we will be talking about besides chronic pain is how that impacts one’s mood. Because, essentially the way that I’ve been taught about chronic pain, especially say like in the VA where I cut my teeth, it just brings people down sometimes, not all the time, but it can. So that another thing that I thought we could talk about. And the last thing, maybe in the last 20 minutes or so, is talking about some of the interventions they got going on already. Like some of this mindfulness stuff, meditation stuff, because I was really hoping to get everyone’s feedback as far as what that means to y’all. And is it important - do you think that’s something that people in the older black community would want. And if not, how can we make changes to it, because you know a lot of these interventions have been made with other demographics in mind, like older white folks, Asian folks, but sometimes the way they’re packaged, the way they’re worded can be a bit off putting and that can be a disservice too, again, to people who have chronic pain. But that’s enough of me, let me kind of like turn this to y’all. I think the first thing I was hoping to get is, you know anyone can start, but what have your experiences been with chronic pain and trying to get treatment for chronic pain. Including say things that worked, things that didn’t work, even things that you know that weren’t given to you at the doctor’s office or the therapist. Maybe could be like ginseng or herbal stuff, talking to a friend or family member, but yeah if anyone’s interested in starting, I'd love to hear.
[ 1:56 Sony]
Carl Baty: I’ll kick in...
Tony: Yeah!
Carl Baty: For as long as I can pretty much remember, I had problems with my knees. I ran 10 miles a day for 18 years, I was boxing, that was my “CH”. Between that and the basketball my knees just hurt all the time. And... and I...I...I wound up... I was 37 when I stepped on something, going down the subway step on the way to work. My right leg slid out from under me and all my weight dropped on my left. And... and I tore a cartilage in the knee.
Tony: I see.
Carl Baty: and I spent the better part of a year trying to get somebody to just look at it. I mean this is the normalest thing, I walk half a block and the thing is so swollen and... and... and no one would [look at it]. But if I did take a look, the orthopedic surgeon took a look and prescribed this medication. And at the time I was working for the railroad, I couldn't work taking the medication. And... and I took the meds, nod off, sleep for four hours, wake up, take the meds. And... and... and... after... after I went back to see my... my orthopedic surgeon, and when I walked in the door the first thing I did was ask for... ask for medication. He said no, he said I’ll tell you what if you give me a second opinion, I’ll fix your knee. I went to Temple Sport’s Clinic, and... and the doctor took one look at it. He said ordinarily I would never recommend the surgery on first visit, but if this has been like this for as long as you say it's been like this, then yeah, I’m gonna sign this. And it went in and did it, it don’t get me wrong, its better, it’s still gonna hurt – its gonna hurt but at least I know where it's you know - you can deal with something better when you know what it is.
Brenda Clark: Yeah [in agreement]
Carl Baty: Than when you don’t know what it is.

Tony: And on that subject, you know, I know that one thing I would love to hear from y’all is, you know, barriers that came up when trying to figure out what to do about this pain. And one thing that could be a barrier, knowing what it is, because pain is really hard to define, I think, and sometimes doctors can
[5:00 from Sony]
also go back and forth, or maybe, you know, they may not know. And I'm curious, what helped you know what it was?
Carl Baty: it just... it wasn’t always the pain but the swelling. When you walk a half a block and your knee if this big, especially when you’re my size... umm I... I... I’m... after the surgery I used to go to physical therapy twice a week and the therapist used to always ask me, he says
“How does it... how... how does this feel?”, “It feels good.” she used to say “this should hurt.” I said “Well it does hurt”, she said “But you said it”, I said “at least now I know where it’s coming from. You’re working with as a holder.” She had a healthy attitude about pain. You’re not gonna be, doctors not gonna keep you here long.
Tony: um any thoughts?
Birdy: To piggyback off the... The whole subject is pain. I play sports all my life, (CH) I mean even as a kid we ran out development of - the word I’m gonna use is the projects - and from the grass to the concrete, depending on what sport we played together, it determined. In the grass, which is tackling, if we’re doing a lot of things as far as running fast and want to be able to cut, so we use the pavement. So, growing up, doing that, you know you know most black kids are very athletic anyway, and when you’re playing games, you don’t know how to much severe damage you’re doing, because you’re a kid and you’re outside and you’re playing. So. as you continue to do these things, and as I got older, I learned. You know I watched a lot of folks' jog, they have special sneakers, they jog in the dirt, they jog in, you know, clay – just certain, you know, areas they would jog at. So, growing up, that was one of the first mistakes a lot of my friends didn’t know. The constant jumping up and down, the constant on the pavement, you know...
Tony: Its gonna wear you down
Birdy: But... It.. It... It's wear and tear, you know, any kind of sport you do is gonna be wear and tear. And eventually, if you’re not, you know, you not one in tune with your body, because what we tend to do is.. Ignore when our bodies give us the warnings before it gets too, it gets to be a severe injury. Growing up, we didn’t have doctors that would tell us these certain things, it was just ok, they will shove medicine in you, and... and that was it. Now, my mother used to take so many pills. It was like, what the – you know, it was one of those confusing things for me. And when they give you pills for whatever your illness is, or whatever you think it is, or what they tell you it is, you read the stuff - some of the words you can’t even pronounce, and then, you know it’s one of those things, it was almost like they disguised the pills or what it's for, so they can keep pushing them into you. Most of the time, my mother was always dazed, you know, and not so coherent. So I... I... I... looked at that growing up and I said to myself you know - I get to a point in my life that I’m not tryna let... let a doctor put say, this is the remedy, take this pill. And the crazy thing is um... I’m diagnosed with diabetes, it's been a year. And the most I've been in a lot of pain, but the diabetes kind of pain they don’t have nothing for it. And its gonna... it's nothing I can do. The pain that is afflicted is at the tips of my fingers and the tips of my toes. Now, if it rains, that’s double pain for me. But just everyday walking, going upstairs, there's aching pain. So, my mind is okay, you cured... You gave me some
[10:00 Sony]
medicine, so my diabetes can stay at a level. But what about the pain I'm getting from the diabetes. So that makes me say to myself you know, “is it worth taking this medicine?”. But it's keeping my sugar low, but I'm in so much pain it's like it's not worth doing anything. You know, so it's just one of those things that you want give that a second opinion. Of course, you're gonna go do the same thing, it's hard to get a second opinion. There's some places that won't even look at you, or... or... give you a appointment if you ain’t got the right MassHealth or insurance. So, we’re stuck, like I wanna go to a hospital but the hospital is going to say “hey, take these pills - the pain is still there” you wanna go get a second opinion, they’re gonna look at you and say “You don’t have this type of insurance”. So it’s almost like we’re ridden off, but they always say - “its for the community, we wanna help the community” well how come I can’t get the same doctor that that guy got who lives in Beverly Hill Park? You know what I’m saying, up in the skyscraper. How come I can’t see the same doctor he sees?” And that’s for me, that’s where this, you know, it just throws me off to say, well, it’s for the community... It’s for the community”. And you ain’t even bringing money into the community. So how do you keep saying it’s for the community.
Tony: What do y’all think?
Joseph Eubanks Jr: I guess I'll say a few things, umm... I was dealing with diseases myself, with insurance, and what plan, and what plan is covered by my PCP, and then certain plans will cover certain PCPs. I am a person that uses um... alternative medicine, so I use, I just, this was at the chiropractor at Madison Square and I use... I have a bad back, and a couple of my physicians said to me, “I know what you’re doing”. I’m like “what do you mean”, and they said “You’re out there playing basketball, playing sports with those young guys. And you’re trying to do what you did 30 years ago”, and he said “You can’t do it”, I said “Well I do a little something. I don’t know about going out there all day or hour, but I might go out there 10-15 mins and play some basketball. And um, especially if they talking trash to me, they talk trash.
Everyone *chuckles*
- I’m getting out there. And you know, my... my... one of my doctors said to me my... my... my podiatrist he said, “You know you can tear your Achilles or your ASL, and you can tear it,” and I said “I don’t care”, I said “they not gonna talk trash to me like I’m an old man in a nursing home, I’m going to get on that court and I’m gonna knock them around” and they gonna say, I’m gonna tell you this, I’m gonna hand check them, I’m gonna grab his shirt, I’m gonna slam him around. I’m gonna be dirty, dirtier than Dennis Rodman or any of them guys, Anthony Mason, any of them guys back in the ‘80s and ‘90s. But I said, I said “I’m gonna be dirty, they ain’t gonna talk trash to me like they’re ready to me in the nursing home, you know what I’m saying. As long as I can get out there for five minutes and I do like this sub, I need a sub. Who can sub in for me haha.
Everyone *chuckles*
But I go through a lot of pain. Like I said, I do acupuncture, massage therapist, and a chiropractor. And some of that stuff, a lot of that stuff, I got to pay out of my own pocket because I only have so many visits.
Everyone *agreeing*
Tony: Because they don’t often cover that stuff with insurance.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Mhm, yes, it’s odd. Sometimes, depends on how the chiropractor or the PCP or somebody writes it up, they give you 12 visits. Sometimes you can get 18 or 20 visits for the whole year.
Tony: Hmmm I see.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: For the whole calendar year. Yes, that’s the trick. Otherwise, you gotta like buy, you gotta buy visits, buy, you know like a package.
Tony: I see.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Like I can buy three for like a hundred dollars. You see what I’m saying. Cause they want that money. Cause Imma tell you between you and I, a lot of umm, a lot of those people, a lot of service providers are not where they were before COVID. They want any money coming in.
Brenda Clark: Right
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Do you see what I’m saying?
[15:00 Sony]
Tony: I see. I see
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Cause what happened is I slipped and fell umm I thought I tore my uh... My... my uh shoulder, my rotator cuff, and I’m gonna tell you date. It was January 19th; it was January 19th 2020. So, what happened in March of 2020?
Brenda Clark: Heh. You tied him up. Yeah
Joseph Eubanks Jr: COVID. So, I’m gonna tell you this, you gonna laugh, I personally did therapy and started chiropractors and the doctors throughout all of COVID. So, I’m literally taking, only one or two people taking the bus in the early morning for a seven o’clock visit. I’m the only one in the office. I’m IM like literally in all these offices I’m the only one. That’s the rule.
Tony: And that’s physical therapy?
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Physical therapy, essential provider. You only can be person in there, one therapist and like maybe a support staff.
Tony: I see.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: So, you couldn’t have no two therapists, you couldn’t even have two patients in here
Tony: Tricky
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Yeah, so if another patient came, if another patient came in, they had to stay out in the hallway. I don’t know if you know the Hampton Inn on Mass Ave and Melinda and Cass (?), I did my physical therapy there. We had to wipe everything down, it was crazy. Everybody had masks on, you had to wipe everyone down before and after, you had to everything down.
Tony: My dad had knee replacement during COVID, so it’s just like that.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Cause I wasn’t gonna do, cause it was like some of the stuff, some of this stuff they was gonna give me all this equipment, and I was like no, I wasn’t, I'm not gonna be lazy. I need someone that can just get on me. Yeah, you know, so I went on uhh... So, I did, what, January through November? During COVID it was crazy, cause some days I was the only one on the bus. I’m the only one on the umm. On the 44 bus and then I get on the number 1 bus or the 47. There’s like 3-5 people, maybe. This is like seven, six thirty, seven thirty in the morning.
Birdy: That’s rush hour.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: That’s rush hour! But it was COVID.
Everyone *agreeing*
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Everybody through people had the coolies, oh ah don’t touch me.
Tony: They’re like walking around you.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Yeah ,they’re like walking around you and all this stuff, so and Uh I deal with a lot of pain. And uh you can’t give medicine like they used to get medicine cause they think everybody’s a.. a pill popper. You know what I’m saying. Now they got the directory and all this stuff. You can’t doctor hop now, you know what I mean by doctor hop. I know they trained you in that. And uh people go to this doctor then they go to that doctor. You can’t do that stuff now, you know what I mean. They can track you down. So, uh I just cope, I just cope. You know, I do the therapists, I really do... do... do... my MassHealth really good. I do my MassHealth. I get my... I get my money's worth out of the deal, let’s put it this way. Cause I know how many visits they pay here. How many visits they pay there. And then like one service provider I’ve had for my PCP he um he wasn’t on one plan. So, the other day. I had to call WellSense and say well he’s not coming on the community plan, he’s on the care plan. So, I had to switch back over, it was just crazy.
Brenda Clark: Yeah, yep. That’s right
Joseph Eubanks Jr: If we want to see a doctor,
Birdy: When going through that, and I’ve been through that. Uhm... I don’t, you’re going to your plan. Some of your symptoms are covered, some of the medicine, or its not due yet, you can’t get it, but yeah, I’m in pain and you know they say you can call a nurse and they can help you go through all this, but at the end of the day it just breaks down to having the right health plan that’s gonna cover it. Because just my medicine man, the insulin is crazy. And then on top of that, I take other medicine for um... for my blood, for uh so the blood won’t clot. But then I take and allergy pill. So, if... if... sometimes I have to say well forget the allergy pill, can I get this insulin medicine? And they’re like, well no you can’t get it yet, and then my strips you know I... I... at one point I was doing testing 4 times a day. I don’t even make it at the end of the month for my strips. So now im... im... im... struggling to say I’m not gonna do it 4 times a day, I’m gonna do it 3 times a day. And now, in the back of my head, its like OK, I need to know where my sugars at. I got to find out, can I eat or not eat that, based on what my sugar level is, so now I’m going through a panic mode.
[20:00 Sony]
And, the good thing about this whole thing of diabetes is they gave me a visiting nurse that comes every day.
Tony + Joseph Eubanks Jr: That’s good.
Birdy: And I think if she didn’t come every day, I probably would just – I would literally feel like I want to jump of the roof or something or a bridge because this is just, this is, when you learn how to ride a bike it’s new to you. So, me going through this diabetic stuff, I got it in the wintertime, summer came last year and the pain was even ten times as... So, it’s a whole new kind of pain for me, like as far as winter and then summer. So, this time I don’t wanna even go out the house.
Tony: and with that visiting nurse, it was good because it kind of met you where you were?
Birdy: She... she... almost like a mother would comfort her kid
Tony: I see, I see.
Birdy: You know, because this is what she does. She deals with maybe 8-12 people a day. You know. So, I'm gonna be honest with her and like “well I forgot to take my medicine last night, I feel asleep” or, uh... “I had to take my meds”. And that’s one the first things she said to me. She said the only way I can help you if you honest to yourself first and then to me, and then we can do this together. And when I first got diagnosed with this, it was Umm I uh coached football and I always donated blood, faithfully for like 8 years. Umm we did this, it’s called Coach Donate Blood because we’re looking at our young kids and they’re getting hurt, and they this, and if they need blood – so we just say “Let’s. Do this.” So, I was doing it for eight years and one time I went in and the guy said, yo yo your blood it’s not reading right, your blood is always reading right, you know. So, he said “You should go talk to your physician and see why.” So, I go and they’re not trying to find that. So im doing a lot of testing. All along, I’m... I’m... I got to go to the bathroom way more than normal.
Tony + Brenda Clark: Mhm [agreeing]
Tony: Cause the way, that’s your nurse down there (CH?)
Birdy: These are warning signs that I never knew about.
Participants: Mhm, yup [agreeing]
Birdy: Im thinking, because I’m a workaholic, I going to work... work, its hot out. But I found myself going to the bathroom. So, I said “Well, maybe I’m drinking too much water.” And then it got to the point where I started getting a little dizzy, another warning sign that I didn’t know. Im thinking, I was in the hot sun, I just didn’t want to wait for the bus so I walk. All along, all this time, I have diabetes, I’m eating sugar like crazy. The last warning that I got was blurriness. Now im running to the hospital. So, what I don’t get is it took all the warning signs.
Brenda Clark: [phone rang] Hi I’m in a meeting, I got to talk to you later. Im in a meeting. Bye
Birdy: So, for me, and I say this is if my body’s telling all the warning signs, and im not keen to it, and I know my body because I've been an athlete all my life, I've been blessed not to get major torn ligaments and you know. The worst thing I ever got - and played two sports, football and basketball from a kid all the way up to an adult - I never got major accidents, so I was blessed. But one of the things my coach used to say is, you know listen to your body, you know. I just didn’t understand like, listen to my body? Your body’s gonna tell you that you’re pushing it too much. Because were not in tune with our bodies, we wasn’t taught this, um... running around with diabetes, im eating sugar, and it... it... it... took me to get my eyes to be blurry. When I got tested, my sugar level was 500. I was supposed to have been passed out I wasn’t speaking coherent.
Tony: and miss Brenda what are your thoughts on all this, you know, this story about getting help from like a visiting nurse. Cause the way she’s talking its making sense and like not having any warning signs when you’re younger, insurance stuff,
[25:00 Sony]
chronic pain, as we’ve been hearing. I want to hear your thoughts too.
Brenda Clark: Well (cough), one of the things is um where a lot of times out of tune, especially men, you don’t... you don’t, you can tell them what they need to do what they need to do. But they’re like nah I’m okay I can do this; I can do that. And then they end up like birdy you know. And sometimes you just have to you know you have to, you as it was said, just listen to your body. But, and as far as pain, my pain is I have back pain, lower back pain from work, um I have migraine headaches, um and just recently I started getting pain in my hips. So, it’s like, its real difficult because I’m in the chair all day and then when I go get out of the chair I go sit in another chair in the house. So, sitting all the time makes it worse. So, I do get, well, I was getting physical therapy and then something... something about my insurance. They said it was WellCare, oh well you we can do your medicine, but we can’t do this. It... I think that one of things that’s really complicated and frustrates people is complication with Medicaid, MassHealth, and the insurance period. You know um, if we were just on something where we knew, you know I can go to the doctor and be seen or get medication, I mean, I have so much pain, it’s crazy. And I was um the first time I had um Percocet's given to me, I think I had a prescription for 30 and um... um... it would last for like weeks and then I ran out and then when I ran out. I went to get it refilled, I had to get it refilled. And the doctor said, well we can’t give you 30 anymore because we have to go by this new... all that new stuff where they track like you were talking about how they track Joe. And so, like you can’t, and I’m like, that to me doesn’t make sense. I know, im on a I have a pain group that I talk to once a week. There are some guys that get like a 100 Percocets, like every..., Maybe a month. Now how... How... how is that so? I mean, what kind of, what kind of... That’s crazy! And I can only, and now I only get 20 and that’s like every 2 months. So, if I am, you know, croaking with pain, I just have to deal w it. You know, and that doesn’t make sense, and that leads to people going out buying, you know, other pills and stuff that can be laced w fentanyl. You know all this is a big circle and it's all tied into each other. It’s, you know, in our communities that’s what's happening.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: self-medication.
Brenda: Yeah! Absolutely
Joseph Eubanks Jr: you know, you know how many friends of mine died during COVID doing illicit... They... they had chronic pain
Brenda: Yeah! And they need it, sometimes you need that pain pill so bad that sometimes you’re willing to risk your life. And I’m not there but I... and I... ain’t gonna be there. But it’s really sad because sometimes the... the person might have just took that one pill, you know, or smoked that one joint and they’re gone. Cause that fentanyl out there, it’s crazy.
Tony: You... you bring up something that, you know, may or may not be a factor here but I wonder has race ever come up when you’re thinking about what it means to get care from a doctor, therapist, and so forth?
Brenda: Oh yeah! Absolutely, people that I’m talking about, they get all the um... percocets and stuff, they’re all white!
Birdy: “CH (sentence)” I don’t care what anybody says, some of my best friends you know I I can’t say their names “CH” the people I’m talking about, those guys that I grew up with you know, uh...uh...uh these guys became police officers
[30:00 Sony]
okay, and Dwayne nelson, so for me and I say this because, some of the advice they gave me I wouldn’t be sitting here, period. You know. Those are some gentlemen that got out the development, I say the projects, and got to really live the black and white type of thing, you know. And if you’re not on the same pages with how the organization is ran, you become ousted. So, all of them, you know, kind of weaved on the bar and stayed on the line to where they’re not getting caught in the foolishness that they do versus what you’re supposed to do as a policer officer or... or just a person in society. So, anything in life for me it breaks down to, you know, color. Say it’s not what it is.
Brenda Clark: And today, they just struck down. Did you hear the news today? That they’re no longer going to be considering, like you know when we go and apply for school or whatever, college, when there’s that box – what is your race? No more, no more. That’s the beginning, that’s just the beginning. They’re gonna be flipping the switch on a whole lotta stuff.
Carl Baty: Judge just killed the affirmative action.
Brenda Clark: you can bet that that’s gonna (sigh)
Birdy: well Zip code is also important too, where you live at.
Brenda Clark: Yup. Mhm
Birdy: They can easily say if you’re a minority or not. Just where you live at. So, sometimes when you go to these doctors and clinics and these places
Tony: They’ll find out before meeting you
Birdy: Yeah! By your name!
Joseph Eubanks Jr: and they treat you differently by your education.
Brenda Clark: Absolutely.
Tony: What is that like?
Birdy: It’s Horrible
Joseph Eubanks Jr: I... I think it’s horrible but treat...treat...treat people according to their, not just race but where they live by zip code or education has been going on for years.
Tony: Like they kind of talk over you, or? Ohh okay.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: You see what I’m saying, especially if they think you’re ignorant of what you are going there for.
Brenda Clark: Yeah, yeah. Mhm
Joseph Eubanks Jr: If you’re knowledgeable I think they treat you differently.
Tony: I see
Brenda Clark: That’s right, and a lot of times I’ve gone to different places and I’ll roll up in there just to see how they talk to me, you know, and then when I come off and I speak to them like you know I got some sense or I know them. It’s a whole different ball game.
Tony: But even if you’re educated and you talk a certain way, if you look a certain way, sometimes they mean -
Brenda Clark: Sometimes the black...the race plays a card! Yeah, and being disabled.
Tony: Mr. Carl, you have to say something?
Carl Baty: Yes, as we talk about faith, my entire life. I gave some back to them that day. Ain't nothing more feared than an intelligent Black man.
*Everyone agreeing
Tony: I see.
Carl Baty: I... I.... was the smartest kid in my junior high school, on a busing program, and I embarrassed them. They had a show just a program like Jeopardy. First kid raises their hand and answers the question. I embarrassed them. What my reward for it was, I wasn’t allowed to the all-boys academic school. I had to go to school in my neighborhood and I was put in classes for learning disabilities. There.
Tony: That’s bizarre.
Birdy: The down point is that you’re very smart and label you as-
Carl Baty: Label you and... and put you in classes where you’re not gonna limit you, suppose you’re not.
Tony: That kind of perpetuates-
Carl Baty: So, what I did every year, I cut some of the classes they gave me and went to the classes that I wanted to take until the teacher put me on the roll. 10th grade I took geometry.
Birdy: How?
Carl Baty: I just go sit in the class until the teacher put me in the roll. I ain’t.. Ima gonna show up every day, you’re not gonna put me not in the roll.
Everyone: *laughing
Carl Baty: The teacher came to me after the midterm and told me “You will no longer be eligible for extra credit”. Why? I also need to get extra credit. Yeah, but your average is a 105. Yeah, but I’m labeled and you’re not gonna remove the label
Brenda Clark: What about, im sorry, go ahead, go ahead.
Carl Baty: This went on right away through my senior yeah. I was taking trigonometry and elemental functions. There was a girl in there, and...and she was a year older than me – Kathy Levey, Kathy Levey. She used to come over there every day, she used to sit across from me and we’d be sitting there. When the teacher gave the first test, hand the first test back out, he said “two people got 100s, Carl and Kathy” Kathy turned around and looked at me and said “Let's have a contest.” Okay, “Let's have a contest to see who can get the most straight hundreds.” Okay, I can do this. Because I went to other classes, I didn’t do the study geometry in all my classes anyway. Not...not geometry but trigonometry. Well, we were tied after the midterm, Kathy and I, we were tied after the midterm. Mr. Goldberg, teacher went to go see who I was. By then it was too little too late. Come to find out this girl was a nineteen-year-old college senior. Math major. You know um, she went on to win, she went on to win. I...I... I... missed one question on Friday and when I walked over to congratulate, she just cried. I was a kid, I didn’t get it, I didn’t get it. But she understood that that this kid, they labeled him, he's doing... he's keeping pace with me, and...and...and I’m a college senior. I been through this before, this is elementary school with me, hes keeping pace. Why he’s never gonna get the opportunities that I had.
Tony: Miss Brenda, were you about to say something?
Brenda: I was just gonna say, and the other thing that they do in the schools. They’ll pass a person; they’ll pass a black student sometimes just to get them out of class. So, they’re now in the next grade up and still can’t. They’re not up to doing the work that they should be, you know. But just to get them out of the class, they’ll do that. It's been done a lot. The system is sick.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: And you know who's behind that? The administration
Tony: Sure
Joseph Eubanks Jr: from the principles to the superintendents....  superintendents of schools. They’ll say “Get rid of him, get rid of her!” Just, just give them a gentleman or a lady seat and im going to the next... im graduating.
Tony: Doesn’t matter if they did them wrong, if they’ve learned. It's just like they want them out.
Brenda Clark: Doesn’t matter, that’s right.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Because they don’t wanna hear from the man, they don’t wanna hear from the superintendent of schools.
Tony: You know, to change the topic, but to keep it on this idea that there are systems-level issues going on that have really wronged people, especially underserved communities. You know, this idea of racism and discrimination being entrenched in this world we live in. I, in a way, am thankful now that the government has decided, that in other ways, you mentioned a few ways that they have introduced failures. But they are offering more funding towards these research programs so we can look at how can we make the way we treat things like chronic pain better for these communities that we neglected in the past, or even wronged. Um, and we talked about some things that you know that the massage, the acupuncture, and things like that. But I also wanted to hear y’alls thoughts on the things that are already being done um that may or may not appeal to say older black individuals' um because of x, y, z reason. Maybe it’s too expensive because the insurance doesn’t cover it. Maybe one is uncomfortable with the fact that this person delivering say this type of therapy isn't someone who gets me, who gets my language, or even looks like me, come from where I’m from and so forth. Um, and so, you know with that in mind, some of the things that are being delivered these days include things like., talk therapy, to sort of empower the individual, get their mind out of this idea that like I can’t do anything about my condition or my influence. So, this idea of being present in the moment to understand what’s going on in the body, in the mind, so that they can take action. Things like meditation, uh stretching exercises, relaxation exercises, yoga. And I mention all of these things at the same time, but just the idea of these non-medication therapeutics. Because as we mentioned, it’s almost like they put the script in terms of what their perspectives are with opioids and medications and so they’re... they’re interested in other ways. But it seems a lot of like what we have to offer, may also offer a disconnect too you know, I’ve heard some things from individuals I've worked with. - and Im not gonna say names because I don’t wanna bias y’all – but im just curious, you know when it comes to things like talk therapy, mindfulness, meditation, yoga. What are those things to y’all and are there reasons why they may or may not appeal to you or other people you’ve met who are maybe in the older black community.
Birdy: Umm... growing up once again, you know, going to see a psychiatrist or allowing somebody to actually like what we’re doing in our neighborhood, it was not cool you know. Because now you’re telling folks that...your problems. So, you know, you know, I...I...I don’t throwing color off, I...I have some of my best friends are Spanish, some of my best friends are white, you know. I was blessed just to see the world, you know her family talked to us about don’t get confined in the projects, like we did. If you can travel, go travel, see other places, see how things work and then you’ll get a understand of the world and the system itself. When I got hurt, my mother would say okay, get you somebody and go lay down. That was...that was how I... go lay down, you know. I could fall and bump my head and not say my mother didn’t know better but that’s just...just - we don’t have insurance, we don’t have money, you know. So, our grandparents, great-great grandparents they did self-medication for us. Different remedies that work. And it wasn’t stuff that would get you addicted. Just some basic cooking things that you’d put together. Here, drink this, your cold will go away, you know. But as a society – that's why I hate the TV, I call it the idiot box. Every time you see a commercial, they’ll say, if you got chronic headaches or if you have allergies – take this, take this – and they’ll tell you real quick, the side effects do you more harm. But as you grow up, they lure you in to take this stuff, without knowing that pharmaceuticals are the biggest drug-dealing people in the world. The doctors work hand-in-hand, the more prescriptions they gonna hand out, the more the pharmaceuticals make their money. And the worst part about it is we got the, what is it, the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration people. They’re just letting them create and make stuff, and use us, especially the inner-city people as guinea pigs. Once they realize, oh these people died from it, because “oh we shouldn’t have put this much, we should’ve put a little less”. Now they wanna recall because guess what, you have 5 kids, 5 kids die because they said that the children asked for them when you know, when its harmful to them. But they died because some of the chemistry that they did was too much, and then they don’t want to take it off the shelf and chill. People are dying. But what we do is we get so much pain, we’re gonna try any and everything.
Tony: And um, what kind of stuff do you remember trying?
Birdy: Umm, get some ginger and boil it, put milk in it. Uh, I remember one of my Spanish speaking friends that lived upstairs, they were literally and this was crazy. The uh, the... the uh, the VA or whatever, the uh, VIX it says “Do not consume”. And I will watch they parent give their children a spoonful of that.
Tony: Oh boy
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Oh rub it on and that’s what we put on your body yeah.
Birdy: And uh, they would, and listen this is the crazy thing. They never got sick, no matter what the time was with little jackets and when I you know sometime when you get to, you’re comfortable with other nationalities, they let you in they house. So I get to go to my Spanish friend’s house and the first thing they tell... they tell the kids is get all your clothes off they get in the tub. Put Vix in the tub. They get out the tub, put the shorts on whatever, flip flop, rub it on them and take a spoonful.
Tony: Asian cultures it’s like that Tiger Balm stuff.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Tiger balm? Ohhh
Birdy: I said it so It says “do not consume”, so whatever work for your... your community or your nationality, you know, I mean there’s a saying that if it work for your great grandparents, well, why was it, it wouldn’t have been awful for you.
Tony: and it seems like there’s individuals taking it. They were, they were fine?
Birdy: Never got sick.
Tony: Never got sick.
Carl Baty: You see them kids running around... running around the street barefoot in the middle of winter time. Never even nose never even get snotty.
Birdy: So, you know, you know, a lot of folks don’t want to deal with uh... American doctors or remedies or stuff because they... they do more harm to your body than good! If you got side effects that says 20 things can happen to you if you consume it, but it’s gonna take away your headache. That should make any human being say wow... Umm... “Im taking the chance of 20 other things is gonna happen, but my headache is gonna away? But now I got 20 other problems that can be life-threatening. So I... I... when I see this stuff in the commercial there, so what is that FDA, what are they for? The food, the “CH”, they oversee all this stuff. But just allowing all these, all these um... corporations to produce, mass-produce medicine and shove it in our throat.
Tony: And do y’all have thoughts on the idea of like non-medication therapies for chronic pain and so forth?
Joseph Eubanks Jr:  You know something that’s so funny? Um... I don’t know if the rest of you have umm... Have noticed this. But over the last 2 years, I’ve noticed several acquaintances and friends of mine who, diabetics, non-diabetics, have missing feet. Their feet were taken off. And Diabetes, chronic pain, whatever you want to call it, but they were subject to amputations.
Brenda Clark: Yep
Joseph Eubanks Jr: I know at least 4 people that are in my circle they got they foot taken off.
Brenda Clark: it’s that “CH” stuff
Joseph Eubanks Jr: You know what I’m saying. Sometimes its they legs.
Brenda Clark: starts with that toe usually.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: And then they blood pressure not being equal, ain’t I’m being right? When they take that blood pressure in the foot, there’s you know, no feeling in the foot. But I know a lot of people that umm... have missing, many women especially men, and I see it really, I see it a lot in the black community. And you know I used to see it down south, but I know I see it a lot in Boston now. We got Mass General, Boston Medical, Baptist Red, Holy small, nice clinics. And I’m like they can’t do anything to help, help save these people’s feet? I don’t know what the problem is. Or they bump it, they bump it into their furniture and they don’t go to the hospital.
Brenda Clark: and they don’t go to the hospital.
*Everyone agreeing.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: And then I tell ‘em, you know, get off your behind, I don’t say the word behind, but get off your whatever, and go up there and see the doctor.
Carl Baty: That happened to me twice
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Yeah, you lucky man
Birdy: And here’s the, see for me-
Brenda Clark: Can’t play with it.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: No, you can’t play with it.
Birdy: you know, when I got diagnosed with diabetes you know first of all it was one of those things, okay they gave me this medicine that only doctors can have and... and injected in me and my diabetes went down quick. They were scared because it wasn’t going down normally, so they gave me... gave me some really powerful insulin that made it go down. I stayed in the hospital for like 3 days and they were scared that it wasn’t going down normal. So, they said, okay, we gotta, and every day they would give me an injection and the nurse would come check, and they would check on me like every, every hour and a half. Because it was going down so slow. Umm... there was this one lady that I wish... I wish I could have got her name; it was a...a Spanish lady. All the doctors and nurses would come in and up...yup, he did, yup, okay, that’s her and she would come in and she said “I know this is overwhelming for you. You know, you have diabetes and you don’t know left right, you just don’t know what to make of it.” To be an athlete all your life and now can’t even walk up a flight of steps without being in pain. That changed my life dramatically, over a year, yeah over a year now. It changed my life to have a better understanding about all these doctors really caring for us or just wanting to get paid? Being in that chair... in that... in that room, and all these doctors probing, picking at me, giving me stuff, and for me, I’m like this “Okay, what’s that for? What’s the name of it? What does it do?” They got attitudes because I wouldn’t let em do that. I need to know what you’re putting into my body. Okay? So now they got a attitude when they come back in my room.
Tony: Yeah, and like who are you?
Joseph Eubanks Jr: And...and...and that’s when I pull out my patient bill of rights. I pull out my patient bill of rights and I tell em “I got days to bring em.” I said to bring em. I don’t remember, I don’t know how long you’ve been a doctor but um... you remember when the Brigham um... had that – my mother was in the neuroscience ICU -
Tony: I trained in the south so...
Joseph Eubanks Jr: And um.. at the Brigham I was getting ready to go to Providence, Rhode Island and um... I was arguing with the doctors, and they was like “well, maybe we need to take her off the ventilator and if she doesn’t breathe...” I’m like “Thats not what her medical wishes are.” so im leaving the hospital, im gonna make the long story short, I’m leaving the hospital, I’m on Route 9, going by Chestnut Hill, there’s a... there’s an alert, there was like doctor shot by patient’s son at Brigham and women. So, all of a sudden, I’m going to Providence, I’m getting all these calls!
Brend Clark *laughing*
Joseph Eubanks Jr: They’re like “Where you at?” And I hear what I should’ve, I should’ve prefaced this I said, “I just left the Brigham, man I gotta get outta here.” He thought it was me, everybody all over the country thought it was me! And I called, I said “That is not me, I go through the call sister, I go through the Department of Public Health.
Brenda Clark: I remember when that happened.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Can you remember when that happened?
Brenda Clark: I remember when that happened.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: And I just said had left, I walked over to the Brookline Village, got in my car, I’m like – don't mess with that... that ventilator. Cause I said, I told to come with my police detective friends. They’ll come over here from the homicide unit. You don’t wanna go to jail, they don’t like police, they don’t like doctors in jail. So I’m like don’t touch that ventilator until I come back and we will not take her off the ventilator until umm – because she still had pneumonia. So, I wanted to try to wean... get the pneumonia in check, then take her off the ventilator. And they said we would be bypassing the sweet spot where she would be on the ventilator too long. And I’m like no, I don’t wanna do it and then if we take her off then like that’s it. We not gonna put the... we not gonna retube it again. So uh... I get in the car and they say, “Your mothers in a lot of pain” she... and I’m like, “I got her medical wishes, you know, she does not and then she wants to be resuscitated. They didn’t like that, the situation. So blo-bla-you know make a long story short, Im up on... I... I... up between Providence, and chestnut hill and I come back the same way, I go back to the Brigham. And you know what happened, right, it must’ve been about 20 police officers.
Tony: they were like – get this... get this guy
Brenda Clark: They were all over.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: But because I was very knowledgeable, and I had friends in high places. Especially they know I knew... because I sit on the Nubian Square Task Force and uh, yeah, and uh, I’ve been on the Task Force before for 5 years and I was doing a lot of stuff with the Department of Public Health. So, I know some people, you know what im saying, and they...they were outside I was saying I know some people, the board of medicine oh they really started getting nervous. Because they know, I said... I said I have friends at the Board of Registration, they you know, they registered, you know, they... they... they licensed nurses and social workers and in Wakefield, in the Board of Medicine. Once I said the Board of Medicine those doctors started treating me a little bit better. And then I pull out my patient Bill of Rights, a friend of mine said, what’s that form you got, the most form?
Tony: Mhm
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Yeah, I had a copy of that. Oh, I had like a dossier, and it was all laminated. But that’s they treated me differently while my mother was still living for a couple of months.
Tony: “CH” that too.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: No, but a lot of people don’t know that there’s a patient bill of rights, you know what I’m saying? And you have a right to... to... to... um to use them, you see what I’m saying. And like you were saying, the issue with pain there’s a lot of people out here with cancer, diabetes, and they’re dealing with the and
[55:00 Sony]
they’re really in pain. And uh, you know what are they gonna give you, two little 400 milligrams of Tylenol?
Brenda Clark: Tylenol!
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Oh, you got people “CH”
Brenda Clark: I said, “What the hell is that supposed to do? Tylenol?! You think Ima come to the emergency for Tylenol?! Uh oh”
Joseph Eubanks Jr: I think that’s an insult!
Brenda Clark: Exactly!
Joseph Eubanks Jr: They give us, they come in here give you two pills 800 milligrams both of them, both of them are 800 total and you’re in chronic pain. I don’t... I don’t know what can be done but it just seems like it could, it... it... be like, you know, could be, you know, alternatives!
Birdy: Well, you get some people who built the system you know, I, she could testify, we grew up in a era, in my era, even in her era, and underneath me. We, how can I say this, um, we did a lot of self-medication, which destroyed the community. Then you got those who want us go right and use the drugs that was prescribed and at the same time we’re now realizing that that’s just bad for us. So, we’re caught in a... in a spot of we self-medicate, we listen to these doctors that don’t care about us. Okay um, I um, I’m recovering from cancer. My brother died from it. And I watched my brother um... just refuse all that because he was a person of natural healing, you know. He just, he didn’t want all that... that doctor stuff and he refused to take chemo.
Tony and Joseph Eubanks Jr: Wow
Brenda Clark: Eh, some people do.
Birdy: The worst cancer you can get is in your lungs, cus those are delicate tissues, ain’t too much you can do there. And you know my brother no matter who came to see him, he refused chemo. The hurting part about when you’re in the hospital and your doctors are saying you need to do this, but you wanna do that, they really got mad at him because he all chemo is...is killing you slower, its poison being put in you to slow down the cancer. Now, because my brother did the research, my brother was it...it...it’s one of those things that, once again, we don’t know you know, about what they’re doing, they’re trying to make us get better, when in... in... in actuality did not. All its doing is slowing the process down. The thing was his hair, he loved his hair. So, taking chemo is going to take his hair off.
Tony: Hm, and it’s tricky kinda towing the line between the things we need to do with regards to what the doctor is saying, and the things we need to do on our own to stay positive and engage in what we need to do to get better from whether it’s cancer, diabetes, chronic pain. And, kinda going back to one of the things um...We were talking about before which is sometimes you can get int this negative thought pattern where you just kinda give up and you can really do anything about it cus the doctors there.
Birdy: Yeah, I’ve been there.
Tony: Mhm. And uh, I just wanted to mention a few other things, but this idea that uh, sometimes you need to think positively to exercise, or do something to get on your feet because if you don’t do stuff your pain can get worse. And um uh, one of those ways that doctors can prescribe it is through those treatments that are now like referred to as talk therapy or even mindfulness or meditation. But was curious what you had thought but before that
Carl Baty: There’s one major one. Um... and... and... that’s the... that’s the divide healing. It does happen. It does happen
Brenda Clark: Oh yeah!
Tony: That’s a good point.
Carl Baty: You know I...I can remember in 1992, uhm, I tried to commit suicide. I took a handful of doarten(?) and washed it down with a three-ounce cocktail of different cough syrups, pulmenol and Robitussin mix. But the next morning didn’t even have a good hangover
Joseph Eubanks Jr: you didn’t even have a good hangover *chuckling*
Carl Baty: I didn’t even have a good angle. So, I put myself into a drug program and in the program I went in, they went to church on Sundays. And...and...and...I...I...I went in there
[1:00:00 Sony]
I went into the church that Sunday. It was two female pastors, they walked up, they... they.. They asked if I wanted a prayer and I walked up went up for a prayer and they laid their hands on me and they said, “You’re healed, your liver is healed!” My...my liver? By the next Friday, I was totally jaundice
Joseph Eubanks Jr: That’s the liver...
Carl Baty: Yeah, well, when I to the hospital first they ran a IV in me. Threw me in a room by myself, everybody coming in and out had a mask on. This nurse after I “CH” she’d run in and get blood, I said “What’s going on?”, she said “the doctor will talk to you.” Whe-when he came in I said Doc, tell me what’s going on in this “CH” group, “What’s going on?” He said,” One of your counts should be 23 its over 1700.” I knew he was talking to toxicology – "CH” – To me it was just that simple. Um... when my grandmother came in, she told me, she said, my...my grandma used to just be there trying to pray. My aunt Lucile? Said “Boy you got to start writing your testimony” I knew then, I knew then that she’s been talking to the doctor and I ain’t going to make it. The next day the same two pastors came in, looked at me and said “God always told you ‘Heal’, that’s all you go to do is believe it.” When I went to bed that night, I tried... I tried to pray ... and I was just honest. God, I don't believe in nothing [tearing up] but if they believe. So, if they believe, I believe.
Brenda Clark: There you are.
Carl Baty: Next day the nurse came, took the blood and all. Came right back to get more blood. I said what's going on. Doctor came in to talk to you. Doctor came in and I said "what's going on doc." "I can't understand but all your counts are back to normal." [repeats] “All your counts are back to normal.”
Tony: That’s amazing
Brenda Clark: Amen
Carl Baty: I-I-I watched my grandmother go in um... she was going into surgery for a gallstone. She ain’t go to the hospital, she-she, when I was little none of the kids went to the hospital. She kept a bottle of blessed oil that she was using it you know. That’s all she would do. And-and when she had gallstones and-and-and she prayed - Couldn’t Hear – I'm her daughter she said “Lucile, what am I doing, I don’t know what I’m doing.” She said, “Mom you ain’t got nothing to do with you.” She said “your friends are dying all around, how you gonna help everybody if you ain’t ever been through them?” So, she going into the surgery, the doctor said “when's the last time you’ve been in the hospital?” The doctor. She said “Last time I gave birth to my youngest daughter, 50 years ago” so he gonna put her under anesthesia, and he said uh “count backwards from ten”. The doctor was the one to come back, “we told her to count backwards from 10, all she was saying was ‘thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus’”. So, we were bringing her out, she was coming back too, she said the only thing she was saying was ‘thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus. Said, I never seen none like that. You know, um they...they...they know there’s something to there, there's something to there.
Brenda Clark: Oh yeah!
Tony: And you know on that one thing I’ve always been curious about, at least back in the day they’ve always made a good point to not include things like faith in what we would consider treatment. But now they’re more open to it, they’ve got pastors coming in. But you know, another thing I’ve been thinking about too with these treatments to chronic pain, they’re saying you know a lot of people try meditation and so forth but what about prayer? And would prayer count as meditation? You know im curious.
Birdy: It’s-it’s-it’s you know, when you when you talk to whoever you talk to. When you meditate, it’s the same thing just worded different. It’s who you believe in and how you talk to a person. You can sit in a room by yourself and talk to yourself, the worst thing people can think you’re crazy but if you talk, people listen, things happen. You know, some of my- my-my you know I was raised in a church, my grandma had a church and being a kid, I-I hate going to my grandmothers because of church. I love going to my grandmothers because she opened me to a whole new world of the wilderness. They would go fishing, you know, my...my...my first cousins are avid fishers, he’s almost a semi-professional and semi-good golfer. So, growing up in you know our parents would always send us to our grandparents and that was just to get a feel of how they lived, why they make decisions they made for us. And if I didn’t experience that, I wouldn’t be able to give the knowledge and-and-and raise my kids the way I would’ve done. Because at the end of the day, you know, you know, I have a I have a it wasn’t an issue, I just didn’t understand why my mother didn’t - back then it was tough love, I’m a beat your behind but I love you. Its gonna hurt me more -
Joseph Eubanks Jr: Its gonna hurt me more than it hurts you! Please
Birdy: Yeah! - Couldn’t hear – It-it blew my mind because guess what? In my era, I’m almost 60, in my era, first of all boys weren’t supposed to cry. That’s the thing that shows weakness in that young punk. Now ok that’s how people looked at it, and growing up, getting my behind whipped and just, some of the things I’ve seen other parents do to their kids, and I questioned my mother. It wasn’t being disrespected, it was “Mom, you’re conflicting pain on me.” I said, “first of all, you know, you can’t call 1800 like you can now, back then, physically, mentally, spiritually I become damaged. What makes black men so tough, they can endure pain and don’t wanna go to the hospital was because of how we was raised and brough up. Now I said as a kid, when I was 12-13 years old, you know, im thinking way down the line, first thing I said to myself was “I’m not going to beat my kids.” You know, my mother showed me tough love, she always loved me hands down but she never gave me a hug. She never said, I love you, see those are some of the things lack in, that bring pain on, it makes us feel less dead. So, when I have my kids, I said I’ll never beat my kids and I would always give em hugs and kisses. Now that broke the cycle for how I was feeling as far as a young man, hurt and pain. Pain comes in a lot of shapes and forms and why a lot of black men are so stubborn, can endure pain, is because – I'm not saying the upbringing was wrong, it’s just that’s what their parents knew. So, you now, for me to tryna help the-my next generation, I take a little bit of what my grandmother taught me, I took some of what my mother taught me, I took some stuff out, add some stuff in – It's just like when you’re a cook. We learn how to cook; I learn how to cook. You know my mother never had measuring cups, my grandmother had measuring cups, but my thinking was “How do you know what to do?” Well, that’s part of upbringing and that a part of enduring pain also. Cuz, when you get a beating it’s painful physically scars you, mentally hurts you, so us as black- young men growing up, we endure more pain than anybody on this earth besides a woman giving birth.
Tony: You know one of things I’m hearing too is the idea that there is things going on like in your family, in your community, that someone like me or my mom may not understand. And um... You know, it’s funny my mom and dad they don’t really speak English, they speak Vietnamese mostly, so they you know, they go see a Vietnamese doctor and you know the Vietnamese doctor kind of gets their-their way of living too whether it’s like they’re more open to the idea that my mom knows like which foods are hot and cold and the idea of like yin and yang and the idea of like just these herbal remedies that my parents are going to use. And um, one of the things that we’re also interested in is the idea that because of a history of race and discrimination, these issues of education, you know people from underserved communities have been gatekept away from positions of you know being a provider in the medical community and so forth. So, that there’s less people from communities of color representing providers and so forth. And so, one idea is bringing these people who are delivering these treatments into the community by getting people from the community to deliver them and also to have these being given, you know, at not astronomical rates especially essentially because of the insurance issues. So, in a way, like learning from someone and then teaching another person these skills, like they were in the past. And these skills can include things like you know talking to a group of people about what it means to recognize pain, warning signs, how to overcome fear to start getting on your feet, or exercising, moving your arms, whatever one can do to essentially get over your pain. Doing things that can do like accepting that prayer could count as meditation, doing things like stretching exercises and so forth. So, it would, essentially, boil it down to having programs that teach these skills to people in the community so that they can deliver it to other people in the community in say, spaces like UCB without having them be inaccessible essentially. I even met miss Yvette, I think, she was doing it in USB, and I was like “This is great! We need more of this, you know, accessible treatments for chronic pain.” But im curious if y’all have thoughts about this idea that we can make these treatments more accessible by like stripping away the high costs, making them more accessible with people you recognize and associate with, or even changing the language and so forth, or changing how they’re done so that you feel less foreign.
Birdy: Well, you got to trust first. You know um, having a pain I have I didn’t trust nobody. You know I didn’t want to talk about it because I didn’t know nothing about this, I heard it, you know like you said – you see people with limbs cut off every day, um, the crazy thing about society, the world, ‘s that there's so many cures out there but they don’t expose it to-to-to people like us, of color. It’s almost like we want them to suffer and then swoop in and be the hero but we want to charge you. You know what im saying, so you know this new experience for me with this diabetes you know, Ima... I love to cook. I had to go to my house, get rid of everything in my house, because having diabetes – everything has sugar in it! Everything! I don’t care, they change the wording, everything, everything! Now, I used to go to the grocery store with my mother and she taught me how to budget, and this brand works the same as this brand, it’s cheaper. And then I would look at white folks and they’re like “what the calories and the sodium.” And I said to myself, “hey what the hell does that have to do with eating it?”
Tony: Yeah, I see.
Birdy: Going back, you know, now, it’s very important to read a label. Because you-you can read a label that says, “40% sugar” and across that it says “added another 50.” Not knowing how to read labels, I’m-I’m not illiterate but not understanding the terms of how they mark it and package it - that’s why the law came out where you have to put what you - what's in your-your product, and they would really not want to do that. It was a struggle for corporations to do that.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: especially with sandwiches and all that stuff, you notice that now over the years, they’ve been pu....pu...putting the calories up there.
Tony: Oh, cause they’re...they’re forced to now,
Joseph Eubanks Jr: They forced to! They don’t want to now.
Tony: I think I see that in McDonalds. Yeah! Cause I see it right on the combo.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: And sometimes I’m looking at that I’m like, “Wait a minute, 2000 calories?” I’m like “Nah, nah” I’m like ….
Brenda Clark: Yep, back up!
Tony: The ice teas...
Joseph Eubanks Jr: The ice teas will get you with the sugar, the ice tea is-
Birdy: Well, I found out, this was so amazing. I lived in Atlanta, about 12 years, and um... you can go to a chicken place, and if you get a bucket of chicken, they give you a free gallon of ice tea.
Tony: Ohhh that’s a whole another meal.
Brenda Clark: that terrible!
Joseph Eubanks Jr: the ice tea so good but you gonna be going to the bathroom every 10 minutes *chuckles*
Birdy: and see this is where, this is where so you would found out, you wouldn’t see that advertising – giving away something free – in the white community. You’re not gonna see that. And it can be the same chicken place, it can be the same chicken place but the chicken place is in a city its gonna give you free tea. In the white community, they’re gonna give you a free gallon of water.
Tony: I see
Birdy: Think about that. So, it’s... it’s... it’s always a target to make us fail or do even worse than what we’re doing versus a gated community. See there's a difference between a gated community in Beverly hills versus a gated project. You know what im saying. The gate is to keep us in one area for Beverly hills it’s a gated community to keep people from getting in. The gate does the same thing, keep people from getting out, it’s how you use that gate. Same thing with medicine.
Brenda Clark: another important thing about having diabetes is, and I don’t know how many doctors tell their patients, that it’s better if you wear socks to wear white ones. So that if you bang your foot, if it bleeds or something, you can see it.
Tony: that’s a game changer.
Brenda Clark: It’s really important. You know, there’s a lot of things that they tell others that they don’t tell us, you know. You have to, really be on it. You know you have to do your homework on your own sometimes, you know, just to stay alive.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: but most people don’t want white socks. My podiatrist told me that, and I laughed, -
Carl Baty: It’s a culture thing.
Brenda Clark: It is a culture thing.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: and if you don’t have nice socks or colorful socks or nice white ones.
Birdy: Michael Jackson took white socks to a whole another level, I kid you not because you look at ethnic people.
Brenda Clark: I have to go.
Birdy: Look at the ethnic people, we wear a lot of dark colors. A lot of dark colors -
Tony: I just want to say one thing, if anyone needs to go, I’m more than already thankful for the time that y’all put in. But I’m more than happy to just keep the conversation going but honestly, I know people gotta be places.
Joseph Eubanks Jr: What time is it?
Tony: But again, I’ll be in contact with y’all with some more details about this.
Brenda Clark: it’s like quarter two.
Tony: Yeah, so if y’all gotta go, completely understand.
(rest of the audio, from ~1:19:00-1:25:30, is participants chatting and leaving)





Tony: I mean, I think that I'll get into this. this more later but a lot of the focus these days has been on looking at involving the community more in research because previously we haven't - we as like a field haven't been doing that too well and unfortunately, that means you know when it comes to research you only hear one kind of voice so people started like looking into it more and realizing that you know the way that we can get more voices is by going right into the community and making sure that we focus on people whose voices haven't been heard yet.
Dorres: That’s… that’s a good thing. Yeah, I want to know how to get into this like, find out about… -
Tony: these kinds of studies?
Dorres: Yeah
Tony: Yeah, and I think that's something too I can help out with after this because Mass General actually has a whole website you can search for studies based off of what you're interested in, if it's like pain, fibromyalgia, thyroid issues, actually I was just helping someone who didn't qualify for this study, find for some studies pertinent to what she was up to. Can y’all hear us okay?
Zoom participants: Yeah, yeah.
Tony: Awesome! Well, in the interest of time, [Zoom notification] oh here we go, we've got another person here. It's a little hard to see but maybe this can be like - better than nothing. Uh could you see what the room looks like without the lights, oh it’s better! Cool, looks like we're getting more folks. Um just making sure everyone can hear me. I think T must be Tayla.
Dorres: They can't see us, you guys.
Tony: Oh, right. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to, as the person coordinating this, I'm just going to turn this as y 'all talk, because I think they can kind of see as I do something like that. Haha
Dorres: I don’t want anyone to see me put a chicken bone in my mouth.
Tony: Oh, okay. Well, at any point, you know. Yeah. So, is everyone ready? I could kind of informally kick start this and people will probably keep joining us. I think we're still waiting on two folks just want to make sure I check my messages because I know, yeah but you know I think we already have like a good group here so is everyone ready? I think I heard you, Ms. Cynthia. - Yeah. - All right, well, you know, what I'll do is I'll introduce myself, talk a little bit about this group. And then I think we can go around and do short introduction, just like name and where you're from and currently living. And then we'll get right into it. it. So, my name is Tony Pham. I'm a psychiatrist at Mass General, and I do clinical work, but I also do research. And so, a big part of my research focus is on chronic pain. But I'm also interested in health disparities, which is the topic of why certain groups, ethno-racial groups, receive less treatment or experience worse outcomes compared to other groups. And, you know, you may have heard me talking about this a little bit before, but, you know, research is becoming more and more community-focused because, unfortunately, a lot of the voices that fed into research interventions was not inclusive of black people and other groups as well, such as Latinos, Asian-Americans, and so forth. So essentially, this group here is about getting the voices of older black Americans. You know, I use that term loosely because I think age is relative. But I bring this up-- I bring this group together because at least from an organizational perspective, people are realizing that chronic pain is a huge issue, especially in the older black population because for many reasons most likely the treatments that we have available really may not be applicable. Because you know the people that developed them and the people who helped developed them were mostly white. So, right now we're actually so lucky because as a research field we're receiving funding to create interventions, behavioral interventions, that is like interventions that don't include medications for older black Americans with chronic pain. Another focus of today will also be the idea that a lot of folks who suffer from chronic pain also suffer from depression in some way or another. So, what we'll do today actually is, it's a little different from the previous groups because some of the previous groups were more about talking about chronic pain, and in this group I'm actually going to ask everyone to chime in with their thoughts and opinions about known interventions, because the idea is - you know, for one reason or another, older black Americans just don't go and get these services. You know, talk therapy, mind-body interventions. And it probably is related to the way that they're packaged or the way that they're delivered, or even because they're not delivered by certain individuals and so forth. And I'd really love to dive into that. So, what I'll do is I'll kind of, like, bring up. one intervention in particular that actually, at least for certain populations, has good evidence for treating chronic pain and depression. And this intervention is called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. It is essentially a combination of talk therapy and mind-body skills. skills, so these include things like meditation and yoga and relaxation exercises. And so yeah, so that's going to be the gist of it, but why don't we get to introductions? Just because I had the folks here on the screen in front of me. Do y’all - I'm going to call out y 'all and if you could unmute yourself and say your name and… and where you're from or currently living that would be great and I'll just call the next person. So, Ms. Cynthia I see you as the first person on our screen.
Cynthia: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Cynthia Jones. I live in Roxbury, Massachusetts.
Tony: Awesome and I see T there. Is that Tayla? I'm not sure if you can hear us right now
Tayla: Yes, yes.
Tony: Is that you Ms. Tayla?
Tayla: Yeah
Tony: Okay good because on our screen. We see just a T, so I just wanted to make sure. And could you -
Tayla: [Couldn’t understand this part of recording]
Tony: Okay, that's great! That's fine I think the internet can be a weird place too if you're putting all your details out there but could you share with us your name and where you're from and where you're currently living? Oh, and we see you now. No, you're fine. And there's no pressure to put it on your video if you don't want to, honestly.
Talya: No, I’m down here trying to click all types of things, I think I made it work. Um, my name is Talya Jones and I live in Sommerville.
Tony: Oh, I forgot to tell everyone where I live! I also live in Sommerville. Uh miss Anne… or Anna?
Anne: Hi, my name is Anne Vaughn. And I live in Plymouth.
Tony: Thank you. And Ms. Nicole?
Nicole: Good afternoon. My name is Nicole Clark and I live in Boston.
Tony: Gotcha. Thank you. And then why don't we go around here in the room? I'm going to try and just to situate the camera. Would you mind starting us off?
Lily: Okay. My name is Lily Bryan and I'm living in Dorchester.
Tony: Thank you.
Doris: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Doris Jackson. and I live in Matapan. Awesome.
Tony: And Nomin, if you could introduce your role too.
Nomin: Yeah. Hello guys. My name is Nomin. I live in Boston and I'm a research coordinator. I'll just be taking some notes while you guys talk.
Tony: Awesome. And another thing I should mention about this is, you know, including with the notes, we're going to re-listen to this because we really want to make sure that we faithfully understand all the rich details that y'all are going to share with us. And so, when you do speak, at least for the first few times, if you could reintroduce yourself by just saying your name, that would help us when we hear better too. So why don't we get started then? I'm going to talk about this intervention piece by piece. And then what I'd really love again is just for y 'all to chime in about how you feel about these pieces of treatment and if you could speak not only from you know, your opinions and your experience, but what you might think others in your community may think as well specifically again like older black Americans because the idea is we want to make something that people want because chronic pain is a big problem so is depression and it's not going to be helped if we have all these solutions that no one wants so being able to hear you know good or bad feedback is why we're here. Because I mean otherwise, we as a community, as a research community, won't know. So, as I said before, mindfulness based cognitive therapy is sort of a mixture of two things. It's a mixture of talk therapy, specifically something called cognitive behavioral therapy. And this talk therapy piece is about thinking about emotions, thoughts, and feelings, and how these things interweave so that they, in a way, impact our daily lives, for good or bad. And then the other piece is, again, the mind-body part. So just to start off, with respect to the cognitive behavioral therapy, you know, this is the idea of like talk therapy. Talking about your feelings, talking about your thoughts, talking about what you do, your behaviors, in relation to things like chronic pain and depression. What comes to mind when you think of that?
Dorris: I’m Dorris, what comes to mind when I think of chronic pain is a lot like, like you said depression, you get depressed you can go on with your daily lives, things that you need to do like work, if you have kids taking care of your kids, I don't have kids, my kids are older thank God. But the chronic pain, it keeps me depressed. I try not to really look at it, but I'm always in pain so I'm always hurting. Yeah, and it stinks you know, it really does. And just recently, I fell in the store just the other day, Five Guys and I was going in there to buy lunch and I tripped over the rug. I went flying right on my hip. I had a hip replacement in like, 2017, and I felt right on that, and I was like screaming in pain. So, that was just Tuesday, and I just feel like, is this ever gonna end?
Tony: And when you think about that as in, as something you might wanna share…. share, say like with a therapist, 101 or in groups, are there opinions about that that you have with respect to like oh that's something we would obviously do or there's something wrong with that idea of like going in and talking about what you just shared with us?
Dorris: Yeah, it's something that I would like to do.
Tony: Okay, thank you. Anyone else want to share? Again, about the idea of, you know, having chronic pain and depression, and the idea of what it means to seek care via talk therapy.
Dorris: Oh, can I add one more thing?
Tony: Oh, yeah!
Dorris: I feel like the doctors don't care. Like once my replacement was done, it came out crappy. A bone snapped it. I had all kind of issues. A bone snapped inside me and he's gonna say, "Oh, you're so small.” You see I'm small on the outside so you know I'm little. And they clamped it. He wired it. it and clamped it and I have this clamp here and these two screws sticking out when I seen it on the x-ray I was like “OMG that's what's in me like that?”  and I had never seen the x-ray and my doctor was trying to pull it down I was like “no leave that up there, I want to see that I never seen that x-ray” and I sleep on that and it just... just hurts constantly and then I tell him I mean they just kind of do it on my doctor because I went my PCP, I went everywhere trying to find out why am I still in all this pain. I got to the placement for the pain to stop and it's just worse.
Tony: Hmm seems like communication wasn't all there
Dorris: Not at all.
Tony: And communication is also something you'd like more of, but maybe because of the doctor's awareness, time or just you know, what not it just didn't happen.
Dorris: No, he was just… he was just very um you know, blunt, to the point. “How's this doing?” You know poking me, and then he was just gone. So, it's like… It's just a lot.
Tony: Anyone else with thoughts about that?
Nicole: I Want to piggyback off of what she said. This is Nicole. I feel like doctors not only do they not care, but they treat patients like a carbon copy. You know what's supposed to work for one should work for everybody else so like when you go to a doctor let them know that you're in pain and they say you know well I have patients that did this, that, and the other it's so difficult for the patient and it almost makes me feel like if I am depressed, I don't want to talk to you about it because you're gonna tell me what you did for somebody else and how it's supposed to work.
Tony: I'll be right back I'm gonna let another person in but y 'all keep talking okay.
Cynthia: I just wanted to jump in and say - this is Cynthia Jones - um in the midst of our talk and the things that we talk more about the pain but we never want to talk about what are the natural opportunities out there rather than just putting more and more chemicals in our body to break it down more and then we need more medications with something else. And when you start to talk about other things that can help, that's a natural way to bring healing to the body. Even, you know, those who are suffering with pain have associated pain with medication and not with diet, not with exercise, not with stretching, which yes it causes you pain, it’s supposed to! Because that's how you get rid of a lot of the inflammation in the body. Right? So those are the things that we're not talking about, but then I find that people aren’t even ready for the conversation, to be able to begin to do some things that we set out that didn't [Couldn’t understand this part of recording] at the doctor and another prescription added on the list here already. That's all.
Dorris: Dorris, myself. I don't take medication from my pain, I'm just going back to physical therapy, that's all they recommend for me, is physical therapy, physical therapy. So, I'm back to doing that, especially when I just had this accident now, so I just got to see where that goes from there. The physical therapy, because to me, it just, I don't know, it just seems like nothing works. And I don't take pain meds, 'cause I don't want to be stuck on that. I don't know, it just goes on and on.
Tony: We're just getting another person here. Actually, while there's a moment of silence, why don't you introduce yourself? You can say your name and where you're from or where you're currently living.
Chana: Um my name is Chana Rogers I'm from Massachusetts, been living here in my life, and I currently live in Mattapan right now.
Tony: Excellent. Well, just to orient you, we're um… talking about the issues of chronic pain and depression among older black Americans, and we're focusing this discussion around this intervention known as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, so I'm going to be talking about a few components of it. I think currently, I was out for a little bit, but we're talking about the idea of seeing someone for talk therapy and what that means good or bad you know like is this something people would actually do for their chronic pain or is this something they wouldn't do because we would want to see a therapist or something. So, apologize I was out for a second, if I cut anyone off feel free to chime in or if another person wants to say something about that, feel free to join in.
Chana: So, like, what are you saying? Say that again?
Tony: So, you know, for example, if you are someone living with chronic pain and depression, and you can speak for yourself, or even other people who would identify as like an older black American, do you think coming in and talking about those issues is something that would help you? And what are the barriers and facilitators? What are the things that enhance your desire to do that? You know, for instance, maybe it's like, I don't identify with this therapist. They're like different from me or something like that.
Chana: Yes, I don't know. It’s nothing wrong with talking to somebody else, you can um… it’s like a photographer! They see things differently in the lens, in your lens of eyes, you see things in here differently. So, um yeah. I would just say to my daughter, she's 22, and I put her in this shelter a couple of months ago. And um you know, she's always saying, "Oh, I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to kill myself." And I'm like, "Why would you wanna do that?" I got her therapy. She's been in therapy, I think since 12, yeah, up until now. And I said, "Killing yourself is not gonna solve anything." Right now, you talking about you got a baby. Okay. I said I went through hell and back and hell and back, okay? And um it never came across my mind to kill myself. I just, my grandmother always told me it's a light at the end of the tunnel, you gotta believe. And with all the hell I went through - and I know other people went through what I went through, and I'm still struggling too. So, you know, you just gotta believe within yourself.
Tony:  I like that. I appreciate you for sharing that. Thank you.
Lily: Yes. I'm Lily, and I would just like to chime in… in on what’s been said. When I think of chronic pains, I mean, I always use the word "excruciating" pain. Just pain, just can't go away from pains that you can't sometimes even identify, how to express them. But on the other hand, it's sometimes you don't share you hold in a lot, well I do, a lot of my pain because I feel like nobody's gonna understand me, nobody's gonna take me serious. Even when you go to the doctor, they'll even ask you well you tell them you in pain and they'll say what is your pain level from zero to ten and you can tell them a 10 and then they're ready to give you medication or say, "Well, go home and take a Tylenol." Also, I find that talking about the pain to another friend or family member is reality. And you find out that a lot of people experience the same pain thing that you are. And you say, "Wow, I didn't know that,” and I'm more vocal now about my pains because after talking to you, Tony, I realized that this is reality, but I do feel depressed, I do feel alone, I do feel like, I don't want to say I feel like I want to kill myself, but I feel like I'm about ready to go into a situation where somebody got to take care of me. And um, you know so talking about it, I think it does help. You know to kind of like; you know express yourself and realize that it's not just you out there by yourself.
Tony: That’s beautiful.
Lily: So that's why I'm here today, because it's kind of like and that's why I came out in person yeah because I wanted to just be able to experience the physical part of seeing someone else that it's you know experiencing pain, you know.
Chana: Yeah, I feel like that too. All this online, yeah, all this Zoom stuff yeah, I can't get with it, I don't know how to fix my phone to do it, you know, and I just like to do it the old-fashioned way. I like to see and meet people, you know?
Tony: Speaking of Zoom, I have to ask everyone to do a quick favor for me. I unfortunately have a Zoom account that's limited by time, which is okay. I just am gonna ask everyone to rejoin at the same link. Is that okay, everyone? - Someone: Yeah.
Tony: All right, so I'm gonna turn this link off and then just go right back into the same link that you came in here through and the clock will reset. All right, see y 'all in a minute.
Someone: Yes. I will try to do it with [Couldn’t understand this part of recording]
Tony: Okay, just rejoin at the same link, okay?
Someone: I’m gonna try to do it but I’m actually driving, so.
Tony: Oh okay, well don't worry. Join back whenever you get a chance to park, okay? Sorry again about this. And feel free to get some food, honestly.
Chana: Please?
Tony: Please! Yeah, we got some plates over there, got some water um yeah there should be an unopened one over there. Let's wait for folks to join back in okay oh yeah. They gotta like rejoin in because the the zoom account I have -
Lily: I’m gonna join through Zoom once I leave out [Couldn’t understand this part of recording]
Tony: Okay!
Lily: I have the Zoom link?
Tony:  I'll send you the zoom link while we're talking actually.
Lily: Okay so once I leave, Ima join right back in?
Tony: Yep, exactly.
Chana: You got napkins?
Tony: Uh… we have napkins like in that maybe out like it's on the, was there a? Oh, there it is, here you go
Chana: Thank you.
Tony: Oh, well here you go! Okay, we’re getting folks back in.
Chana: Days like this I usually stay in the bed
Lily: Yes
Dorris: [Couldn’t understand this part of recording]
(talking about the food)
Lily: I think because it’s getting too moist
Tony: Oh yeah!
Chana: the fries are cold
Tony: Sorry about that.
Chana: It’s okay! Ima still eat it anyway.
Tony: Can everyone still hear us? Awesome, were you about to say something?
Lily: Yeah, I was just gonna finish adding to what I was saying when I felt like sometimes even though you're in pain you don't want to share because you feel like people don't want to listen. They think that you’re just whining and I'm speaking for myself because I have a niece that was dealing with fibromyalgia and I never heard of that word, but my thing was that I always felt like you know she just trying to get attention. She's just this, you know, why don't she just go somewhere and sit down and yadda yadda yadda. So, you know, and I feel bad when I realized that this stuff is reality, you know. And so, I think there are people out there that don't experience the kind of pain that people are, and they just think that they just wanted to be whining and it's reality so I think it's good to talk and to share. I went and said hi to her later one day and I literally touched her and she just like “oh my gosh I'm in pain” because she said that her she is in so much pain sometimes that just for someone to just put their hands on her it just triggers her pain. So again it's real.
Tony: Thank you again for that. I'm gonna pivot a little just to be mindful of everyone's time but you know so that piece that we just talked about is the talk part and the other part of this intervention again called mindfulness based cognitive therapy, is the idea that we're also doing exercises together. And this is, again, a group intervention typically, say with like eight folks. And some of the things that we'll be doing, at least from some conversations I've had, can be hit or miss. And so, I'd really love to hear whether you think it's something that will be a hit or miss. And if so, you know, why? And so one thing that typically is done as a part of this intervention is the idea of meditation and I wish we had more time to get into it but um essentially the idea of meditation for chronic pain and depression is the idea of changing your relationship to pain so it's not going to completely take it away but almost by virtue of changing the way you relate to this pain? Almost encouraging you to not fear it as much and thus still engage in things that give you joy such as physical activity, in some level or another, or even just living your life, you know and getting out there and doing things in spite of the pain. So, you know when I break up the idea of meditation, in general too, what do you think would be the kind of like acceptance of this kind of practice among you or other people who would identify as older black Americans?
Chana: Repeat the last part again?
Tony: Yeah, you know, what do you think is the acceptability of something like meditation among older Black Americans?
Chana: I don't Black Americans, I don’t think we meditate. I mean cause our life is like totally different from other races – I think. And you really don't have no time to be meditating. Okay?
Tony: I see.
Lily: Busy people and -
Dorres: I agree with that.
Chana: Yeah, all different kind of aspects. Yes. So, um, I don't know what I do is, I go in my room, away from my children and everything. I do it more now that I have a room, because my kids had rooms, but I slept on the couch in the living room, you know, so I had a room, but I didn't have no bed or nothing. Now I got a bed, dresser and TV. So, my meditation is praying.
Tony: Okay
Chana: And that’s all.
Tony: Can you tell us more about praying as the form of like focus and attention for you?
Chana: I just say to prayer, I say a prayer. and I just ask God to help me, I come to thank you for letting me get through this day and help me to see and focus on the next day. You can only do one day at a time. And that's it. And I just say thank you. Thank you for letting me see the day, letting me see tomorrow. And just thank you for the little things that I have that, what is it, I don't know if I should have it, but I'm thankful to having it.
Tony: You're appreciative of -
Chana: I appreciate it, yeah!
Tony: I love that. I just wanted to highlight that because, if I understand correctly, faith is a big part of people's lives.
Chana: Yeah. Especially African Americans. I mean you know, way back then, from my understanding, what my great grandfather used to tell us, that's all they had was prayer. I mean, you know, they were living to keep them going, you know.
Tony: In spite of everything.
Chana: Yeah, 'cause my great-grandfather and great-grandmother, they were immigrants. They came from Nova Scotia. They came over here from Nova Scotia. That's how the family began.
Tony: I see, and if anyone is in the chat, you know feel free to unmute and just kind of just say something because I know it could be awkward sometimes putting your voice out there, but we won't take it personally if you interrupt us. Anyone else have thoughts on that idea?
Lily: I agree with -
Cynthia: I’m gonna jump on and say -
Lily: Oh, go on.
Cynthia: I was going to just quickly say, so what I was just talking about earlier is fitting. I totally agree with the faith and the prayer and things like that. So, I think that when you're thinking about, you know, African-Americans, you know, when you say meditate, we don't push faith but we pray and so it's the difference in language makes it [Couldn’t understand this part of recording - Zoom audio recording was glitching]. But I will also join that with others … [Couldn’t understand this part of recording] … it's not talking about pain without solutions. So, the exercise part of it is excellent. Now so my thing is incorporating and I mentioned the natural, you know natural movement because I am a woman of prayer and faith and I just believe that God has already given us everything on the earth to heal our bodies. We may have not come across it you know so you know I believe a lot of the conversation should be sharing about different options or things that people just don't know about, so you make it more of not just talking about your pain, but also educating people around there are other options other than just medication, getting your back wrapped, and all that other stuff, you know what I mean? That's my opinion, yes I am someone that lives with pain every day, and I just find the more that I, sometimes it creepts up on me, but the more I keep my mind off of it and keep moving forward to do what I got to do in a day, there's less focus on the pain rather than the pain directing on my life.
Tony: I like that. The idea of focus is such a key idea in this therapy that we're trying to make together because sometimes focus can completely color our experiences and even worsen pain and so being able to, whether it's focusing on faith, focusing on belief, focusing on pleasant activities again not completely removing pain but it does help at least from the literature. But thank you again for sharing that. It's so important to hear these opinions because sometimes these opinions have been lost because you know essentially when these interventions were made, they drew from a lot of say like East Asian religions or they did not choose to include faith because that was almost like taboo like “oh don't bring God into the idea of treatment” because that's seen as like unscientific or something. But you know, it seems like from this discussion people are bringing it up. And again, feel free to interrupt out there. Okay, but I wanted to bring up another part of the intervention, which is the idea of, again relaxation exercises. So another thing people do as a part of this therapy is things like yoga, stretching, relaxation exercises, and so forth. And when you think of yourselves doing that, you know, not like full-on yoga, like the kind that is gonna definitely kind of worsen the pain, but even like gentle yoga, like these sort of postures that could be as simple as sitting down, lying down, stretching the neck. stretching the legs, and so forth. Do you think that's something folks here would want to do when it comes to, say, again, their chronic pain and their depression?
Lily: You weren't here when I mentioned, Dorris, that now I have to go to rehab, physical therapy. And I had, that fact that had just came from there when I came here, so. So, I was in pain even more 'cause he was failing on stuff and he had me on that bed thing and it was like rolling on my back and my back was hurting. He was telling me to stretch my hands and do this and do that. But then they gave me an ice pack but I didn't get home yet to put it on, but. It helps a little bit better, I think, but that's what they recommend is physical therapy. So, that's a part of like stretching out and doing certain things with your body to help relieve your pain.
Tony: I like that, thank you. I see a lot of folks I have referred to PT over the years and it can be quite stressful but also, I've heard many good things too and I think the idea, you know if it's done right, is keeping your body active even though there are barriers you're facing that others are, you know this pain idea, this distress idea. And again, part of this therapy is about kind of reinterpreting what you feel you can do, so as not to prevent you from doing that, so you don't get deconditioned or fatigued in ways because you're just kind of not moving. Another thing I wanted to bring up, and again, if anyone just sort of has like a stray thought in relation to something before, oh were you about to say something? If anyone has a thought from something we were talking about previously, feel free to go back to it. I'm just kind of going through a list of things that I thought about bringing up. But, you know, this idea of meditation again. Sometimes it's done just sitting, eyes closed. But, you know, sometimes people do it with their eyes open. And one thing we're hearing is maybe meditation could be prayer, thinking about God. But I'm also curious if others have ideas as far as, you know, things that they may make meditation more comfortable. Because it doesn't have to be sort of like that idea of like sitting cross-legged with your hands to your side. You could be knitting. You could be doing certain activities. And I'm curious, folks have ideas, you know, when it comes to this idea of sitting down and reflecting. If there's something that might make it more almost like fun or applicable to you know your life.
Chana: I don’t know. My meditation is eating and sleeping. Sleeping more - I relax. I relax when I'm asleep. I really do and I don't like it. I do it more now that I'm not 100% active. I would like to be a little more active, like when we was out there and I looked at those stairs. And I'm still thinking I should have walked up the stairs. But I didn't, but one day.
Tony: That's really funny. That's really funny, 'cause I was there with you.
Chana: Yeah, the lady said, "You can take the stairs." Mmm okay.
Tony: Well, you know, I will say, you know, everyone's gotta read their body different, but a part of this therapy is almost kind of walking through those motions of walking up the stairs and seeing whether it is something you could do, because sometimes it's true, you know, you might not be able to go up the stairs but sometimes it's like we have a small - with this big fear of a little pain and that can prevent us from being able to do what we need to do in life. Another thing I'm thinking about too is you know we're talking about people right now sharing stories about their pain and you know one thing that I wonder is if you know as a part of this therapy of like the top part and the fact that this is going to be a group, would it make sense to offer time to like share stories? You know about what people have gone through or would that make it too personal
Lily: [Couldn’t understand this part of recording] … what somebody has gone through might help somebody else.
Tony: And I think that one thing that I've learned is how people, at least when I’ve been to these groups, people start talking about all these things that I never knew about. Somebody brings up, "Oh, I have been wanting to do swimming," and someone's like, "Oh, free classes at the Y," and all these kinds of things. It's interesting how when community comes together around the topic, people are helping each other out in ways that doctors and therapists have no idea about. So that's really good to know. I think -just make sure that we cover everything and again I know that we're kind of like approaching the time still, but I want to walk through some of the key things that we've been thinking about to make these kinds of therapies more applicable. And so, one thing that maybe an elephant in the room is the idea that a lot of therapists out there who are doing these kinds of groups they tend to be white. And you know, my family's Asian, Vietnamese in particular, they see a Vietnamese doctor. It's just the way it is. They don't speak English. And sometimes they just prefer someone who kind of like knows their background, how they think, what they believe in. And, you know, at least from what I've heard in the community, sometimes race does matter when you're looking for help. And I'm curious, is this something that resonates with y 'all, the idea of seeing someone who looks like you, who came from the same area as you?
Chana: Sometimes, well, not sometimes, that's the reality. I'd rather deal with someone in my same race because the majority of the time, they grew up where I grew up. Not the same state. It could be - It don't have to be the same state, but they grew up.
Tony: They get the culture.
Chana: Yeah.
Dorres: They've been where she's been.
Chana: Yeah.
Tony: Yeah. So, you don't have to like explain all these things.
Chana: Yeah. Well, yeah, you don't have to explain much, but they understand.
Tony: Almost through their lived experience.
Chana: Yeah.
Tony: I can see that.
Chana: I think that, um, I prefer and you know, let me ask you, you know, is that a racist thing? No, it's not a racist thing. Even if a Caucasian person grew up, I don't know, would you call South Boston a hood? I guess so.
Lily: Kind of, yes. That's like a project.
Chana: Okay, but yeah
Tony: people knowing that experience and being able to just relate with it like because they just grown up around with it
Chana: Just like, for instance -
Dorres: I'm from JP projects, so you know.
Chana: Yeah, I went to what’s that... Blaine's well, it's not called Blaine’s anymore. I want to hair school so I say to the lady I'd rather have somebody African American. They, she asked me why? And then I said because our hair is a totally different texture and they understand. Not that I don't want, you know, but like
Tony: my mom's a hairdresser and she always tells me like she doesn't know, you know, all the different hair types, she's Asian.
Chana: Yeah, so y'all hair different from us and I said she might not understand how I want my hair, you know.
Lily: And it's not going to be racist, at all.
Chana: And she thought I was being racist and she had to go talk to somebody of my skin color to understand what I was saying. In a way, I took it as an offence, but then I said, "I'ma just let it go. I'ma let it go." Because, you know, I got all the colors in my family.
Lily: Mhm, I do too.
Chana: Yeah. And you know, so then there it goes. She was like, "Oh, okay, now I want to understand." I was like, "Yeah." When you're dealing with, when you're in a profession, where you deal with all types of people, you got to understand what they're saying and where they're coming from and where they want to go.
Tony and Lily: Exactly.
Tony: I love it.
Lily: I agree, I had that same experience even when I went to get my hair done.
Chana: When I was younger, I'm 57 now. When I was younger, I would pop off, you know? -
Lily: Yes. -
Chana: But I learned-
Lily: That's the hood stuff.
[chuckling]
Chana: But I learned to talk to him about it, say what I feel. Not in an angry way, but another way.
Lily: Right.
Chana: Or just walk away, right?
Lily: and enjoy
Chana: Yeah, keep from going to jail, because everything is loud. Back in the day, you could hear somebody walk away, but yeah, it was like, if you hear somebody, you go to jail.
[chuckling]
Tony: Speaking of settings, this idea of coming from a certain place and knowing a certain thing about what it means to be and live, you know, one thing that is, a part of any therapy is where it's delivered you know sometimes it's in a hospital sometimes it's in this far away clinic and you know sometimes it's right there in the community you know I'm curious is it the case where if we had this type of therapy being delivered would it be easier if it was say like at a community center like the UCB space or even like a beauty salon or church you know places where it's like already there or does that not matter as much?
Dorres: I don't feel like it would matter, it's how it's delivered
Chana: Yeah yeah
Tony: okay
Lily: You could do me in a basement
Chana: Mhm, we can talk in the basement. Or we can sit in the van and talk, whatever. It only takes a few minutes to make a group of me.
Tony: I see. So, travel distance may not be a big deal either?
Chana: No, because everybody don't have a vehicle. And I mean the transportation is the big yellow and black, white vehicle I've been called Bus.
[Chuckling]
Tony: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Lily: A lot of people don’t have vehicles.
Tony: Yeah. And were you about to say something?
Lily: Well, she was speaking about, you know, is it important where the meetings are held? Well, I think in some instances - and how it is delivered, I think in some instances, location can be important and the reason why and I like it being here, I was like impressed when you were saying you was looking for a library Roxbury, Dorchester yeah that was like yeah that's down my alley but I've taken many focus groups and a lot of them was downtown, waterfront right by the financial center and you right there in the midst of that, you’re in a different environment
Tony: Kind of like corporate energy?
Lily: Yeah so you in a different environment and you feel like, you know, how do I fit in here? But in here, I'm around my own people. So I fit, even though my skin don’t look like, look like that.
Tony: Yeah.
Lily: I'm one of y 'all.
Tony: I love it. I love it.
Lily: But I hope I don't offend nobody.
Chana and Dorres: No!
Lily: But yeah, so I feel like sometimes the environment, it helps. Even though I went to the focus groups and the incentive was great, but was I really relaxed and comfortable? No. Am I really relaxed and comfortable here? Yes. I'm even dreading the fact that I might have to leave.
Tony: Well, you know, if you want to delay that ride, we have the room till, I think 3:30. But we understand if you want to join by Zoom later, that's totally cool. Okay, uh, miss Nicole just joined us I know you've been there's been a few things that just came up, so I completely understand if you have a minute or a second feel free to just Introduce yourself and where you're from or where you're currently living.
Nicole: I got knocked off like just two seconds ago
Tony: Okay, good... good. Oh, right... right got it. Um, well. Sorry about that. I was waiting for Miss Sylvia, so I had a brain fart there. But I think another thing that I wanted to bring up is another idea to make this kind of more applicable. And one thing that I've noticed just being, you know, like an MD, whatever, is that there's a lot of people out there who are pretty... pretty good at doing stuff just the same stuff I'm doing but maybe because of you know barriers to education, resources it's like they didn't have that privilege that I had to go through med school and do all that stuff but I see and I meet patients I'm like wow like you know this stuff you know. And so, one thing that we've been thinking about is you know reducing the access barriers to becoming, say, like an instructor for this type of intervention. So, you know, one idea is, you know, what if we, like, train people in the community who may not have these fancy degrees because maybe they're not important. But they may be people who could specialize in some way by going through some community-delivered trainings. And then, um... it to people in the community and maybe training others as well. You know this could this is sort of controversial because at the same time you know you're not talking about someone who's been through the whole grad school thing but at least someone who has been through some kind of version of this this training like do you think that would be something you're interested in or would be interested in?
Someone: Say that again.
Tony: And just rephrase it? Yeah, go for it? Miss Cynthia?
Cynthia: Can I say something?
Tony: Yeah, yep, yep, say go for it. Go ahead
Cynthia: Okay, because there's a few things I'm gonna go back and forth.
Tony: Yeah, no, go go wherever you want.
Cynthia: You have mentioned about, so you mentioned that the exercise and the yoga, so now I don't have an issue with stretching and all those things, but me being a Christian, I would have an issue with when you say yoga. So, if we're doing some type of practice, it's one thing, but if you're putting forth, we're going to do different stretching positions will help. But some, like myself, may not be OK with that. Or do you even have a variety wherein you have different groups? So maybe there is a yoga group. But then there is another kind of stretching when you're talking about different people running um different groups. So, then you're meeting people where they're at with what it is that they need and want. As far as the issue of the who, for me personally, the who really isn't the issue if they're able to deliver. It's more of the where. When you talk to people. [Couldn’t understand this part of recording] go to a location that's not even in their area. That's when it becomes [Couldn’t understand this part of recording] Like you're talking about having locals to do it, so you're not just [Couldn’t understand this part of recording]. But you're also, hopefully, looking at some level of compensation, so that you're bringing something to the community that is economically, you know, sound or balanced or whatever, so you're taking care of kind of the whole person in the community, if that makes sense, what I'm saying. So, hopefully, that's understood. We don't need just more programs coming in just to get the numbers, but to bring it to the community so that when after it's gone, the community is better and not just walk away with the numbers.
Tony: I see.
Cynthia: Okay, hopefully I didn't get too personal on it.
Tony: No, you're doing great.
Cynthia: You know, you understand what I'm talking about as far as with the research part of things. We've had too much research come into our community where they walk away with everything that they want but then they kind of leave us with not much of anything other than they just walk away with their research.
Tony: Right
Cynthia: Just kind of counteracting some of that.
Tony: I love it
Cynthia: And I also wanted to say that the issue with the people, the issue with more of location and I do think that people that are like you have a level of compassion when they are looking, when they're concerned is about you feeling better. That's all I want to say.
Tony: I love those things and I'm going to come back to them, but I have to bring up another issue, which is the room again is going to kick everyone out. Would it be okay if I asked everyone to rejoin one last time?
Lily: I'm getting ready to go.
Tony: You getting ready to go? Okay.
Dorres: Me too
Tony: Okay. All right, well anyone who's got to go actually, you know, feel free to go. I completely understand. Yeah, I'm gonna reach out again and just get everyone's information especially because we're gonna need some of the name, address, and a social just to get the checks out. But I'll reach out after this. Thank you so much for coming in. you Yeah, feel free to if you want like I know that there's not like a to-go box, but if you want to take anything with you. So if anyone who wants to join in again, I'm gonna remake the room so just kind of recognize that I'm gonna close the room and if you still have bandwidth or time to talk feel free to join back in all right everyone. Thank you again for coming it means a lot to have people come in person because yeah
[people grabbing food and leaving]
Tony: Let's see, we're probably not going to get everyone coming back because we're already over three, but we'll just kind of continue the conversation informally. Did you have a thought about this idea of the who being, say, someone from the community?
Chana: Um, no, well like lady was saying, it's not just about coming to the community, get your numbers or whatever thing then you're leaving, don't come back, you know. I don't mind going wherever. I make myself fit in even if nobody don't want me to fit in. in. You know what I'm saying? But this would be nice if you could continue, even if it's not research or whatever.
Tony: And I think that's a really good topic because a part of this idea is making it so it doesn't have to be a part of research. You can continue without the researchers by having folks in the community who are trained to deliver and maybe even bring up other people to deliver I mean, it doesn't really like need like Mass General, other people coming in. Yeah, this is this conversation and piloting it is almost like the seed that that it grows from, yeah. Another issue that miss Cynthia brought up was the idea of like cost. We want to make sure that the community is supported. I don't know if it would be something in the future where people could be paid to do this, but I do think that cost is a big issue when it comes to attending classes, therapy. And I'm wondering, is cost a barrier though from your perspective?
Chana: Meaning what?
Tony: Just like paying, like...
Chana: like a little fee?
Tony: Yeah like a large fee, a little fee, like I guess I'm curious because a lot of these programs they don't typically are they're not typically covered by insurance
Chana: A large fee will kind of be hard because everybody is not working and getting a certain amount of money and you have to budget, you know, I know I do. And that's, yeah, it all depends. It really all depends on everybody else's status of income. You know? Yeah. I know mine is mmm.
Tony: I see. Hmm, okay. Maybe the last thing I'd like to bring up is the idea of how long it lasts as well. I know - uh, well, here she goes.
Chana: I say, 8 weeks, that's like 2 months or 3 months and go from there.
Tony: So just to interrupt, typically this type of intervention, we're talking about for folks who didn't hear the initial part, we're talking about what would be a good time interval for this intervention so typically it's delivered every week for eight weeks for about two or three hours and I don't want this to be something permanent but I'm just curious what are your thoughts about this being delivered say like every week for eight weeks for in two-hour sessions, too long, too short, too frequent ?
Chana: Say that again?
Tony: Um eight weeks two hours per session.
Chana: Once a week, right?
Tony: Yes
Chana: But for eight weeks?
Tony: Yup
Chana: Oh, that's fine. Okay. I'm just gonna work it out in the schedule. Like me, I don't have nothing really to do. I'm basically in the house. I come out when needed. Like I mentor at UCB. And I just come out when I needed to go to my doctor's appointment or to the grocery store, and that's it. I really don't have friends at this point.
Tony: I see.
Chana: No, I don't even talk on the phone.
Tony: Oh, I see.
Chana: It’s not that – I just choose to find me, you know.
Tony: I see, so you do a lot of like solitude with yourself.
Chana: I, yeah, and it's kind of, I don't know. So many times, it's kind of dangerous, but. -
Tony: Being by yourself all the time?
Chana: Yeah.
Tony: Yeah, and that is a theme sometimes when it comes to being afflicted by say like chronic pain, or, you know. having being in a low mood you just kind of put yourself - not you - but like you find yourself in the situation. What about the idea of it being say like two versus one hour?
Chana: No, two hours is fine, one hour goes by quick.
Tony: Oh okay, yeah.
Chana: You know, yeah. Just get in there and then an hour goes by quick. you know? What do others think about the idea of it being two versus one hour?
Cynthia: Personally, I would say I think that for sessions like that, two hours is a long time. Although it does go by fast, but when you're talking about a two month most period of time of commitment and getting people to commit to that, that's a lot of commitment when you're talking about because it's not like you're talking about two hours once a month, you're talking about two hours every week. That's a huge time commitment. And yes, you're committed to your body and to your health. But the reality is, you know, if you don't have much to... do then it may work for you but when you're looking at the community as a whole and you're trying to reach people with pain I would... I would say that I think that... I think that two hours is too long.
Tony: I see
Cynthia: Even if you did, it [Couldn’t understand this part of recording] two hours. After that we have one hour session. Yeah, I mean, like, but you got to be mindful of people's time and their commitment.
Tony: Yeah, and I imagine people are busy sometimes too, whether it's like family, work, you know, errands, and you know, even when we aren't working, sometimes I've heard people have trouble kind of managing everything. So, I thought it would be important to talk about how long it is because it is typically two or three hours. but I also want to make sure that if we do develop this, we make it so that it fits with people's lives. So that's really good to know.
Cynthia: And I think you also have to consider maybe you know Zoom as well because in the winter in the weather it's bad you're not going to get people with pain coming out, that's just not going to happen. But then they gonna want to start canceling sessions and you know so those are things to just consider if you don't want to cancel sessions then you're gonna have to have that accommodation there to be able to say hey maybe we'll do some of the - it's a lot easier for someone to do a two-hour session at home where they can be taking care of other things compared to if you got to go somewhere and do something for two hours the time of going, for preparing to go, and going travel time, and coming back, now you're looking at more of five hours of a day.
Tony: I see.
Cynthia: Four to five hours of a day. That's a huge block of time and you're talking about for eight weeks.
Chana: That’s a good point
Cynthia: When you think about it, there's other things that are connected to just that time
Tony: That's great.
Chana: Yeah, that's a very good point. I didn't think about it like that, thank you!
Tony: Yeah. You know, when you think about virtual, you know, what do you think it would work if it was like, as they call it, hybrid, where it's like people are coming and there's a virtual, or do you think it'll be better if it was like all virtual or all in person and having separate classes?
Cynthia: I would say hybrid. And the second option would be virtual.
Tony: Okay, I love it
Cynthia: Because people learn how to operate in their house and how to use little things, you know and when you can when you can attach that to your space it's more likely that you will do it in your space afterwards, when that class is over with.
Tony: I like that
Cynthia: And I'm talking too much so i'm gonna...
Tony: No you're not talking too much You're... you're speaking you're speaking all the things that I'm just thankful to hear because at the end of the day, it's about everyone's voices here, and I wanna make sure everyone has an opportunity to speak and you're telling us all the good stuff, honestly. So thank you.
Cynthia: Now, I just wanna, I do wanna say one more thing.
Tony: Yeah, go for it.
Cynthia: Go back to, you mentioned something about the cost and, you know, adding a cost on and you know for people to be able to get a small stipend or something that is doing the work, you know when I said that my thought wasn't on the people given the money because you a lot of people that are dealing with pain every day also are disabled. So, they don't have that income my thought was more on if you're going to put something like that in place then find at least some grant funding that will sustain the program after, you know, even if you say two years or a year or whatever, so that those are already rolled in and it's not going to be a tax on those who need it the most. So that was what I was thinking something more of to make sure, okay, you all don't want to run the program, but you can set something up for the program to be put in place to run on it, you know what I mean. mean? [Couldn’t understand this part of recording] Yeah, yeah something and to actually help the people, you know, when you're talking about someone's time, you know, now you're talking about eight, you know, eight weeks, eight to 16 hours of someone's life and we didn't even add in travel and you're saying it didn't do that for free. So, it's like, in balance.
Tony: I love that.
Chana: That's a good thought too.
Tony: I would say luckily, we do have grant funding to do something, or like to deliver this kind of intervention as we talk about it in the community. And we're definitely going to be looking at doing it more. Again, to kind of kick start this so that it can evolve within the community, with this like funding. in the beginning. Another thing that I forgot to ask about which I think is pretty relevant is almost like, you know, Ms. Cynthia, you actually brought up this idea of like how we label things because sometimes if we call it yoga or meditation, it can be a bit off-putting because it just reminds people of other things. But I'm also curious, this therapy itself could have its own name. And if you're thinking about this therapy as something for pain and depression that's also inclusive of, you know, talking about stuff, story sharing, meditation, mindfulness, you know. Is there a kind of name that comes to mind? And I'm just gonna, you know, I'll throw out some other stuff later, but you know, if you even thought about, you know, what this could be called, do you have any ideas?
Cynthia: Well, I'm thinking, just having a name of whatever the program is, like the exercise itself doesn't have to have a name attached to it. Okay. It can be stretching. It's incorporated in the description, but also staying away from people's religion, you know, understanding that, that is a religion within itself. And so, you don't don't want to introduce or open, you know, you don't want people to be involved in something that if they knew that it was this, they wouldn't be involved in it. So, we don't want to be deceptive about anything. But to be open to how do we incorporate different movements, which we know that there is, and there’s stretching in theirs, you know, this strengthening that happens with exercise and stretching. Incorporate those things without it being attached to someone else's spiritual belief. Even if this is, you're shifting into mind, body, spirit, but you let people go into their place of whatever their place is. So, you can all be in the room, and if I'm praying, I don't want to be almost forced to pray to someone else's God. And I don't want to be put in that type of situation. I wouldn't want to put someone in that situation.
Tony: Absolutely. And if I understand you correctly, maybe, like, just imagining a scenario where we're putting out flyers and we're getting folks that kind of join some of these first sessions, you know, that are going to be essentially guided by some of these first sessions, I don't want to be put in that type of situation. off this conversation. It seems like, at least if there is a name, having a name that is more descriptive, like, you know, exercise, stretching, and something like that, that doesn't include things related to religion, that's going to be acceptable. Because a lot of times, you know, like, at least for this intervention, it's going to be called like, or it was called mindfulness based cognitive therapy, and that already has the word mindfulness. in it, which can be a bit much.
Cynthia: Mm -hmm, mm -hmm.
Tony: So, what I'll do is I'll kind of like bring up all the topics we brought up and open this up again if anyone has any last thoughts. But overall, we've been talking about chronic pain, talking about depression, talking about this intervention, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, talking about under this therapy, the idea of it being inclusive of meditation, talk therapy, yoga, talking about how it could be delivered in the community, it could be financially accessible, it could be delivered by someone who is familiar with your own practices, your beliefs. We talked about the idea that it should not force people to think about religions that are not, you know, their own. We also talked about maybe the possibility of it being someone, the instructor being someone from the community and so forth. Any last thoughts when I kind of conclude like that? All the topics we brought up and again feel free to talk about any or all of them
Cynthia: My phone blanked out for a minute, but the cognitive part, I think that should be more descriptive than the word because many people will not clearly understand what it is that you're trying to get across.
Tony: Ohhh. Okay, that is kind of a jargony word. Anyone else have thoughts? Ms. Cynthia, your phone cut out for a second, but we did hear you about the cognitive part. Anyone else have thoughts about, you know, overall, all the things we talked about, something you wanted to share but you didn't get a chance to?
Someone on Zoom: As far as cognitive, you need to expand that more so everyone will understand what it is that you're referring to. Because not everyone who hears cognitive would know what cognitive is.
Tony: And that might be a lesson overall for this type of therapy, because it is filled with a lot of these words that, you know, we're not really using on a day-by-day basis. So maybe thinking, rethinking how we talk about the ideas so that people are on the same page and not feeling like it's some kind of vague thing like cognitive therapy or whatnot. Anyone else have thoughts they wanted to share? I do know we've been doing this for about an hour, hour and a half and I don't want to keep people longer than is necessary because like we said you know hours are already a long time. But I just wanted to say again I'm so thankful to have everyone here and just to be able to have this discussion, it's an honor honestly. So, thank you again and if you have any questions about anything related to today all y'all have my contact information so feel free to reach out call text or whatnot and if there's any resources or you know issues that you're also facing I'm happy to kind of workshop that because I'm sure this may have brought up a lot of, you know things in your head about what it means to have chronic pain or depression or even other ailments that you're suffering from. Again, feel free to reach out. We'll be reaching out again because we will need some you know details to make sure we can get that checked to you because we are thankful of what you've been able to offer us because we again we really want to make sure this is a community-based therapy that includes voices that you know are important towards its acceptance so we'll be reaching out about that but again feel free to hop off or head out or you know exchangeinformation if you want, but again, thank you so much, everyone.
Chana: So are you gonna have another focus group?
Cynthia: Thank you.
Tony: So that's a good question. I know that we're getting more funding, hopefully. So, the one idea that I've been really wanting to do is the idea that we can continue having focus groups as the interventions develop, because we are gonna roll it out. And we'd like to just hear everyone's thoughts because it'll be sort of like an evolution you know where you know we introduce these things and maybe it's not a perfect fit and we're going to roll out this intervention in the community so it is technically possible you know if you went to this that you could also take part in the intervention itself. So that'll be down the road as well. Maybe I think after January because we have to, we have to really, Nomin and I and some other people are gonna have to sit down and think about all these important ideas that we've been given and actually kind of create like a manual workshop for how this is delivered and that'll take us a few months but after January we should have our stuff together and then we'd be able to roll it out and there'd be more opportunities and so forth.

00:01
Tony: All right, we're just going to record this because it is nice for us to kind of re review some of the feedback y'all are going to give us. Any issues with that, you know, feel free to just chime in right now. So again, thank you for coming. Where the you know, Mass General Mind, Body program for chronic pain and mood,

00:21
Tony: as y'all already known, this is kind of like a follow up focus group, because y'all have already come and and participated before. And the reason that we're doing this is because, you know, initially, we were getting general feedback about

00:36
Tony: people's perceptions about chronic pain, especially things like depression and mood as it pertains to black senior communities.

00:46
Tony: And we use that information and that feedback to really craft together parts of this program that we're putting together again. It's like this mindfulness meditation type program for both chronic pain and mood. And the reason we're bringing everyone back is because nice, Ms Brenda is here,

01:05
Tony: is because, you know, we're, like, working pretty hard. You know, it is a lot of work. So the the progress kind of comes slowly, but we're chipping away at it. And we do have, like, parts of the program kind of in development,

01:22
Tony: and we'd like to show you those parts so that we can get your feedback. So at any point during this presentation, feel free to interrupt or just say whatever's on your mind,

01:32
Tony: feedback. We know, we welcome super negative feedback. We also welcome super positive feedback. You know, the point is, you know, we're trying to make this program from the ground up, and so the the more fresh, the more raw you are with your impressions about things that we're going to show you honestly. It not only helps us make it for y'all and everyone else, like, you know, in the Roxbury, Dorchester, Boston area, but it also helps other people who haven't been able to be a part of like this conversation.

02:03
Tony: Next slide.

02:11
Tony: Nice. Okay, so y'all probably have already met us, either in person or on phone. This is me on the left. This Nomin, Mary and Denise is also here. She recently joined our team. This is her picture. I kind of stole it from the web. Sorry, Denise

02:30
Tony: and Denise, by the way, if you ever want to chime in too during this focus group, I know you just come in and now, but feel free to chime in whenever, too. And I think after this, maybe we can go around and do some quick introductions. Can't talk too much, just because I want to make time for you know, talking about the manual. But perhaps we can go around. I'll call on folks to say their name, where they're calling from, and how their day is going. So my name is Tony, calling in from Mass General right now. I'm in my office, and my day is going okay. I have to meet some friends later for Halloween, and I haven't really made my costume, so I'll probably just do that after work and just let it, let it be.

03:14
Tony: All right, Mary, how about you?

03:21
Mary: Hi, everyone. My name is Mary. I am a clinical research coordinator on the study or one of the many studies that I'm on, and I feel like I've talked to some of you guys early speaking about different studies. So sorry for the confusion. Sometimes

03:39
Mary: I am calling from home. I'm working from home to today, but typically I am at the office, and my day is going really, really well. I just finished my cup of tea for the day, so I'm very awake right now.

03:54
Denise: And Denise,

03:58
Denise: hi everyone. My name is Denise. I'm an intern helping Tony Nomin and Mary

04:06
Denise: do this work, facilitate this focus group and work on this intervention.

04:13
Denise: Right now I'm in New York because I'm still in school and I'm studying in New York, but I'm originally from Lawrence, Massachusetts, and my day is going well. I only have one class today, so I'm taking it easy and I'll pass it over to Nomin.

04:33
Nome: Hi everyone. It's nice to see some faces to familiar voices.

04:40
Nomin: My name is Nomin. I'm also another research coordinator. I've talked to some of y'all before. I am calling in from home today. I don't usually work on Thursdays, but wanted to show my face and talk to some of y'all today. And my day's going very good. I had great lunch, and I will pass it off to.

05:00
Timothy: Mr. Timothy,

05:05
Nomin: I think you're muted. Mr. Timothy,

05:13
Tony: let's see if I can ask to unmute, but we can also come back to him, not really care how to unmute folks? Oh, wait, I don't know. Anyway, I'll just go down the list.

05:27
Tony: Oh, we can hear you now.

05:30
Tony: Or no, you can hear me.
Timothy: My name's

05:34
Tony: yes, no, can you hear me? Yeah, it's a little, I don't know. Yes, it's a little, kind of like, there's a little, like, some sound issues, but I think overall, let me try changing the screen

05:47
Tony: I might be related to your like, it's kind of slow, maybe where you are staying right where you stand in it, Tim, And we could hear you.
Tony: Okay, sorry about that. I

06:03
Yep,

06:09
you moved

06:14
what? Hey,

06:16
Tony: Mr. Tammy, I'll give you some more time. It seems like maybe right now, your connections kind of spotty.

06:23
Tony: I'll come back to you. Okay,

06:30
Tony: let's see, Miss Brenda, would you please introduce yourself, where you're calling from, and how your day is going?

06:40
Brenda: Okay? My name is Brenda, and I am calling from home in the Fenway area. And so far, my day is going well. I went out for a while, and it's beautiful. And I really appreciate this weather today.

06:59
Tony: Thank you. Um,

07:01
Tony: I actually just might take a moment. Miss Talia, are you? Are you actually there?
Taila: I am here. Hi. I just wanted to clarify. Actually, we're just, we're recruiting folks to do one focus group per
Taila: Yeah, I'm going to ask about that, because, for whatever reason, you register me for both yesterday and today.
Tony: Oh, okay, sorry about that. You know if you, if you want to stay in chat, that's totally cool, but really you only needed to come to one so either, okay, okay, but you're welcome.
Taila: Yeah, you're welcome, everybody. Alright. Thoughts, great.

07:38
Tiawanna: Rest of the day. Miss Tiawanna, yes. Hi. My name is Tiawanna, and I live in Dorchester, and I'm having a good day today. I was outside, very nice outside, and I was drawing the weather. Yeah, yeah, thank you. And,

07:56
Tony: Oh, gotcha. Uh,

07:58
Tony: Miss Nadine,

08:00
Nadine: Hi, this is Nadine, and I live in Jamaica Plain. And in the interest of pain,

08:07
Nadine: what's been on my mind today since it is Halloween, and I do have a four year old grandson, you know, we wanted to go. My daughter wants to take him to spooky streets, which isn't too far from here, you know, to celebrate Halloween. And like,

08:20
Nadine: I've donated a lot of time today just thinking about, will I be able to make it? I have shoulder pain, I have knee pain, you know, let me take some motrin,  you know, around noon time, so that by, you know, four o'clock I'll be able to maybe feel more comfortable. So my day is my day. I'm home. But in terms of mentally thinking about activities, you know, the pain is always on my mind. We

08:49
Tony: appreciate you sharing that, and we might want to circle back that to that too, because it'll be some of it'll be a theme across some of the things we'll be presenting to y'all today. Miss Blanca, I don't know if I know you're at work, but yes, really awesome.

09:04
Blanca: Hi. I'm Blanca Gomez. I am from heading home. I'm a placement specialist, coordinator here and living

09:15
Blanca: I could say I live all over because I don't have a situation.

09:22
Uh,

09:24
Tony: I think, because she's at work, maybe her connection spotting,
(): you're breaking up for Blanca

09:35
maybe we should also come back to ms Lawson

09:39
my end, because since I'm currently hold us is,

09:45
no,

09:47
that's probably a delay right now.

09:55
Blanca: Hello, okay, so I'm gonna try to do it fast. Okay, I'm blanking.

10:00
Blanca: Miss. I am a placement specialist from head and home. I'm a coordinator. Here,

10:06
Blanca: I live all over because I'm currently homeless, but I put my billing address as my daughter, which is Roxbury board and raised here, I joined into this focus room group because I have consistent migraine pains, and I have a lot of joint pains, and they are thinking that they want to do a knee replacement partial, but I'm hesitating. I'm only 51 but I really don't want to have a knee replacement. But if it has to be, it has to be, but I'm trying to figure out why I'm always in chronic pain. I know I have arthritis, but it's just too much going on with me, with the joint pains and my migraines that it's I don't have no solution at this point.

10:52
Tony: Well, I appreciate you bringing that up, too. Um, and out of curiosity, do you know if Mr. Miguel is coming? No worries. If you can't, but just wanted to do check in about that if you I'm not too sure, I could try to text him on my phone, but, yeah, I wouldn't stress about it. Yeah, I wouldn't stress about it. Just wanted to make sure he's okay. Okay.

11:15
Tony: Okay, going down. I think Miss Dorothy's next.

11:22
Tony: Miss. Dorothy cotton,

11:26
Tony: AKA your dot.

11:30
Dorothy: Good afternoon, everyone

11:33
Dorothy: from Dorchester, I'm doing good right now. When I woke up, I had leg pain, and I didn't know yoga from my chair yoga online. So I'm feeling a lot better. My mood was a little down, but as the day go by, I'm doing really good. It's good to see you Tony and everyone here, likewise.

11:53
Leah: Next up is Miss Leah.

12:00
Tony: Miss Leah, can you hear us?

12:05
Tony: I'll circle back to you. How about Mr. Timmy, are you?

12:09
Tony: How's your connection going? Right now,

12:13
Leah: I can talk now if you want me to
Tony: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, please.
Leah:  It took me a minute to unmute.
Tony: Yeah. It happens to

12:21
Tony: me too.
Leah: This is Leah Dotten who lives in Mattapan

12:25
Leah: and unfortunately I wake up in pain too. I have dealing with this edema, swollenness in my knees and my ankles.

12:38
Leah: But I'm just blessed to be alive, and I'm so thankful for that.
Tony:  I

12:45
Tony: am thankful for that too. Thank

12:48
Tony: you. Next, just going back to you, Mr. Timmy, are you?

12:53
Timothy: Are you able to hear this? Can you? Can you hear me now?
Timothy:  Yeah, okay, Hi, I'm Timmy. I am currently in Worcester

13:03
Timothy: I'm glad to participate in another one of your studies, and my data is going pretty good. Thank you.
Tony: Awesome. Mr. Timmy, I should also give you a heads up. You are, I think the only guy who was able to make it to one of these focus groups. So, you know, I do think your input is going to be very important. We need your guy input so, you know, especially if you're thinking about some, you know, black seniors who identify as men, I would love for you to kind of give like, some general sense of like, whether it's such and such thing on our program is going to work or not, because we want to make this inclusive for both women and men,

13:43
Tony: so no pressure.

13:45
Tony: And lastly, Miss Vicky, are you there?

13:50
Vicki: Good afternoon. My name is Vicki. I live in Dorchester.

13:56
Vicki: It's good to be in another focused group. Tony, thank you.

14:03
Vicki: Today is not a good day for me. I'm in a lot of pain,

14:09
Vicki: but

14:11
Vicki: I'm grateful, and I'm thankful to be here still, and I'm praying and hoping for it to turn a little bit better by the end of the day when my grandson comes home, I want to at least be able to enjoy him for Halloween for a little while.

14:30
Vicki: Thank you.
Tony: Thank you. And did, by any chance, did I miss anyone?

14:37
Tony: All right, so it looks like we are good. I will say again, thank you so much for everyone telling me about their day. Sounds like, you know, it's kind of a across the spectrum here. Some good days are going on right now and some bad days are going on. And it seems like some of the bad is also related to pain. And I'm really hoping that although you are in pain.

15:00
Tony: And if you could kind of use some of the feelings you're having right now as you're seeing some of these materials, I think it would also help us gage whether this is something say someone who is like actively in pain would want to do

15:14
Tony: so again, feel free to be as honest as you can. Another

15:20
Tony: warning is that this focus group is going to be a little bit more dry compared to other focus groups, because, as opposed to having sort of like a very

15:30
Tony: broad conversation about certain topics, we're going to be very specific about certain things that we're going to show in this PowerPoint. And some of that's going to include us just kind of walking you through it, reading it, listening to some audio clips and so forth. So just bear with us, and I promise you, it should be not super painful, but it'll be very helpful at the very least.

15:53
Tony: Next slide.

15:57
Tony: Also wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Kincaid, as always, you know, for being there for this project, he's been shepherding a lot of what's been going on behind the scenes, next slide, and

16:10
Tony: then everyone here, you know, I really appreciate y'all coming to the focus groups and participating and just helping us make sure that what we're making is A community based effort, and that it makes sense for folks who are, you know, living in Roxbury, Dorchester and other Boston communities. So with that, I think that's going to be it for me. I'm going to hang out in the background, but I'm going to pass it to Mary, and she's going to take it

16:41
Tony: away. Mary, do you go?
Mary:  I got it. I can go through it quickly. Thank you, everyone again for being here today.

16:51
Mary: So with regards to what's going to happen, can you hear me?

16:59
Mary: So I'm not sure if someone spoke. So in case I just interrupted someone.

17:06
Mary: All right, so again today, I'm gonna like, just provide a brief overview of what our session is gonna look like. And so I'm just gonna like, just kind of like, let you know that we're gonna go over the introduction and session one, mainly focusing on those two, just kind of getting your feedback and on like the different materials that we have. And then we'll go over sessions two to eight, way more quicker than my sessions session one and the introduction we'll talk about, like certain materials we'll be using. Dr Tony had mentioned listening to an audio recording, getting your feedback on that, getting your feedback on some handouts that we're gonna like, we're hoping to share with you and as well as like participants and other materials, and to get your feedback on that as well. So again, we're gonna go over the introduction session one, which is orientation and introduction. Session Two, awareness of the body and automatic pilot. Session Three, gathering the scattered mind. Session Four, recognizing thinking

18:16
Mary: and then sessions five, thoughts are not facts. Session Six, allowing and letting be, session seven, taking care of myself, and session eight, which is maintenance. So these are, like the brief these are the titles of each session that are going to be in the manual.

18:35
Mary: So just quickly going into the introduction again, as you notice, like, as we go through the slides, there'll be, like a lot of text. So just bear with me as I go through it. So

18:47
Mary: here we go. Unless Norman, do you want to go through this part?

18:51
Nomin: Yeah, of course. So just to give like, a brief overview of the program in general, the program is eight weeks long, once a week for one hour that we're assuming we're working on two separate programs. Both are similar, but this one specifically will be talking about chronic pain and mood, while the other one talks about chronic pain and memory issues. It's a Mind Body program. So when we say mind body, we're talking about things like mindfulness, physical activity and exercise, meditation, etc. And we're hoping to take an already established type of therapy called mindfulness based cognitive therapy and adapt it for older black adults. And in the future, we're hoping to adapt it for other populations as well, but this is so far what we have. And while Mary brings up the PowerPoint again, I'll just give an overview of the introduction. So from our focus group yesterday and the day before, we've realized that.

20:00
Nomin: We do have a lot of text, so we're working on condensing it. And I think the idea is we're going to have these shown as videos. So either me, Dr Tony or Mary or even Denise, we're going to film ourselves introducing everything, talking about the goal, talking about some ground rules, so that it's easier for people to follow along rather than reading everything. And so the program goal is to enhance mood, physical functioning and well being for those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. And what we mean by musculoskeletal pain, it we describe things like joint pain, arthritis, muscle pain, tendon pain, and it's pain that doesn't have to do with like, for example, cancer.

20:51
And

20:55
Nomin: what we will do in the program is it'll be hybrid, so we're hoping that people can come in person, but if for some reason, whether that's weather, whether that's you can't make it that day, there's the option for virtual as well, and

21:16
Nomin: we hope to teach ways people can Manage outside like life stress, and make sure that they want to be more physically active, and also just reconnect with life, with friends, with family, and then potentially through learning all of those skills, we can decrease pain episodes over time.

21:39
Nomin: So that's what we have in mind our instructor. So the person that will be delivering this program is actually someone from the community.

21:48
Nomin: She will be trained by Dr Tony. And so the person that you guys, everyone will be working with will be an older black adult with chronic pain, and who has experienced similar things.

22:05
Nomin: And Mary, if you want to go to can you move to the side

22:13
Nomin: and the next one? Okay, so before we go to the program details,

22:21
Nomin: we're hoping to have also like home practice exercises. And from yesterday's focus group, we've heard that the term homework may not work well with everyone, just because no one really wants to do homework, and if they do, maybe make it a little bit more engaging

22:41
Nomin: so that it becomes a habit for folks, though, so that things like mindfulness meditation is something that you practice every day, and we can ask more about the home practices and stuff like that later on. But before we jump into logistics and details about the program, does anyone have any questions, comments or feedbacks, things that they like, things that they don't so far,

23:08
Vicki: I just wanted to ask the question

23:12
Vicki: you said, you like to see them in person? Where would the meetings be?

23:19
Nomin: So we're thinking of we're also thinking about places as well. So that is up to discussion. Yesterday, we had talks of Grove Hall library, maybe central Boston elderly services somewhere within the Roxbury Dorchester area, just so it's accessible for everyone,

23:41
and preferably somewhere that's close to like a bus line or a train line. Okay, alright, thank you. Are these,

23:50
Dorothy: these sessions, different from this session?

23:53
Dorothy: I mean, for the whole thing is connected together. This whole program is connected together. For one or you're saying you want to see if we want to participate in some kind of other study that's longer.

24:05
Nomin: So this thing, this zoom session right now, is basically y'all helping us build the program. So we have all of these ideas in mind, but we just really want opinions from people that matter, that it's not researchers or people that are thinking what y'all need, but y'all actually telling us what you guys prefer, what you want to see happen, what's more accessible. And then, from the information that we gathered today, we're going to actually make the program and then deliver it later. Later on,

24:43
Mary: all right. Thank you so much for that Nomin and on the topic of locations, and as Nomin had mentioned, like a lot of people had mentioned, like grove Hall, possibly the senior center, Roxbury Public Library, do you guys have any I guess, like I.

25:00
Mary: Ideas on other locations that you guys have maybe attended to with various programs that you feel like would be good for us to know as we are, kind of like putting these programs together.

25:15
Dorothy: The Dorchester Public Library is is fine with me.

25:21
Dorothy: Um, it's on the bus line and it's easier to get to.

25:33
Mary: So definitely, we're trying to look for locations that are accessible via public transportation, as well as like locations that are accessible in terms of like, making sure like people can, like walk in properly, without any like issues in that regard as well.

25:57
Mary: And so here just kind of like with confidential confidentiality, we ask that everyone respects each other's privacy in the group. We don't discuss these other people's experiences outside of the program during the session, the facilitator may encourage you to share your experiences with chronic pain, stress, sadness or the program itself. So you can help others learn how to apply these skills during daily life, but you also have the choice of how much you want to share as well, just knowing that, like, there's a rule where, like, whatever you said, stays within the group, just so like, you know, we protect people's privacy, and then ground rules with regards to the program itself,

26:39
Mary: you can't, you can attend. If you can't attend the session, please let the facilitator know, or a member of the research team know ahead of time. Be on time. Plan to arrive five minutes early if you can before the session starts, just to make sure you're not late as well as like you're not just disrupting the session. If he has already started reviewing your workbook before every session. During the session, the facility tailor may ask you to share your experiences with the home practice and exercises that we will share with you later on, treat everyone with kindness and respect, like listening without interrupting others and making space for everyone to share their stories and celebrating each other's achievements. Commit to attending all sessions. Consistency is key in getting the most out of the program itself.

27:32
Mary: And when we are on Zoom, since Nomin had discussed it could probably be like a hybrid format, where some people are in person, other people are in zoom, turning off,

27:44
Mary: like your speaker, maybe if you're on Zoom while others are speaking as well as, like, silencing your phone to minimize distractions, and then feeling free to, like, stand up, stretch or walk if you're in person as well.

28:02
Mary: Right? And so with regards to instruction, these are one of the key concepts I want to introduce within the manuals, the key points about chronic pain, musculoskeletal pain. Why do experience pain? Like, using this graphic to really explain this concept, so everybody's able to, like, understand it. Because, you know, some of this jargon can be very, very medical understanding. Like, pain is your brain's alert system. Pain is a signal from your brain to your nerves to your body.

28:37
Mary: And then, like, let's look at this illustration together, looking at this that, what do you guys feel so far like, does it help you better understand that? Like, pain alert system, what are your thoughts so far?

28:57
Tony: Another thing that y'all could weigh in on is just like, what kind of graphics work in general, especially when you're thinking about learning new material, whether it's about pain, depression, mind, body skills, because I recognize that everyone here is probably a different type of learner. So really curious about what really draws your attention when you're looking at a graphic too

29:20
Vicki: well for me, it's just looking at this.

29:25
Vicki: It looked like the person's body is in pain all over.

29:33
Vicki: And I can, I can really feel the pain, especially when I look at the redness in the hand and with how that pain shoot down your arm, and it can just continue on through your body.

29:49
Vicki: I'm not good with

29:53
Vicki: the pain, with the drawings and whatnot, but I'm good with knowing about.

30:00
Vicki: when there's a lot of pain

30:04
Tony: understood.

30:07
Tony: See, Miss Brenda's got something in the chat. Are we going to get an actual workbook? We're planning to give it the workbook to folks in different ways, one of which is on a website which will have links to audio files and video files. And then we're also hoping to print one out for folks, if that's their preference, so they can fill out the workbook and kind of record their thoughts so that they can share them again during the next session.

30:33
Tony: Okay, sorry, passing it back to you all if anyone has feedback about graphics in general, or this graphic and so forth.

30:40
Mary: And also here, Blanca in, like in the chat, said the constant pain is  reflection. It can start from the brain, nervous system might take I mean, you're welcome to also, like speak as well, if you can. But definitely the graphic, just trying to show you, like the pain pathway, telling you like, oh, like when you see here, like the orange arrows, letting you know that, oh, when you burn your heart, your hand, like you have this like signal, like going through your nerves, going to your brain, like letting your brain know, like, oh, we burned our hand, right? And so, like, having this graphic helping you better, like, understand those concepts and how pain might be interpreted by your mind.

31:25
And we have something else in the chat here.

31:28
Mary: Leah says that she likes the graphics

31:32
Mary: because it's like the visual aspect of them want to like make it as visual pleasing as possible as well. Thank you so much for that.

31:40
Mary: Okay, what do we mean by musculoskeletal pain? Pain can start from an injury, surgery or illness or sometimes without explanation, something like arthritis simply happens as we get older, because we have different different types of pain. We also have different terms for those different types of pain. This includes musculoskeletal pain, nerve pain, cancerous pain, and so forth. It is important to distinguish among these different types of pain, because different types of pain may require different treatments. This program focuses on musculoskeletal pain, and that is non cancerous pain in one's bones, muscles or tissue. Let me

32:20
Mary: see here,

32:28
Mary: what do we mean by chronic pain? Pain can last. That is pain that can last for more than months or even years, even after you physically heal. With the medical community, the term chronic is chronic pain, typically refers to pain lasting for more than three months. That's why, when, like we've screened you, sometimes we ask, Oh, have you had pain for more than three months, or persistent pain? This program focuses. The main goal of this program is to help you learn techniques that primarily work for chronic pain. As a treatment for chronic pain differs from acute pain, or pain lasting for more than three months,

33:06
Mary: alright, and these are other graphics where we're just trying to basically help you better understand what the difference is between acute pain and chronic pain, as you see here, like acute pain is defined as pain from A recent injury, let's say it's sprain or a broken bone, and the pain of it for that is that the nurse sends a helpful signal to your brain that movie may be dangerous or might worsen your injury, as you can see here. And then, like, the helpful response for that is like, maybe like resting and healing or going to seek medical care for that as well, and helpful responses that, let's say, if you like, sprain an ankle and then, like you keep moving despite the pain, right? Or avoiding medical care when it's necessary. But when it comes to chronic pain, that is defined as pain lasting for more than three months, such as arthritis or healing from surgery, and the pain alert from that is, even though there's no harm or injury, you still feel the pain. So that's like, the unhelpful pain alert to your brain. But moving is safe, right?

34:13
Mary: And so, like with this program, we're trying to target that chronic pain, letting you know that, like, you know it's safe to do this physical activities, even if, like, there's that pain there, and helpful response may be, I'm gonna admit someone here, self isolating, avoiding physical activity. And helpful responses might be turning down the pain alert, maintaining independence and health. You know, like making sure you have, like, continue to see your friends and family be continue to be physically active and spending time with loved ones as well. Just trying to get your feedback on it. What do you guys think about like this visual and this graphic and maybe, how do you think we can better, improve it, so that we can explain these concepts better? Yeah.

35:06
Timothy: I think the graph said that we've shown so far, images have been, you know,

35:14
Timothy: very informative, along with the explanation,

35:19
Timothy: you know, I mean, because the visual would be just the words next to him, don't quite tell the person. Yes,

35:42
Mary: absolutely, thank you so much.
Brenda: This is Brenda. I,

35:47
Brenda: I, I like the graphics,

35:51
Brenda: along with the the way it's set up, I think it's very helpful to see what you guys are explaining. And

36:02
Brenda: I think, I think it's really good so fast,

36:08
Mary: absolutely, and just to answer Leah's question in the chat, is that in the manual, we definitely, like hope will make these graphics a little bit bigger so people are able to, like, visually see them, so that, like, I know when it's really small, like on the screen like this, it can be hard to see them, but we definitely will make them bigger in the manual and the material that we distribute out to the community, with regards to the program,

36:36
Vicki: yeah, I think they're very explainable. And I like how you all have them, where they give you the definition and give you an idea of what you go through and what you are enduring, to let you know which is different. I like that.

36:59
Mary: Thank you so much, everyone

37:04
Mary: right going on here as well. What else shapes chronic pain? Many factors may shape chronic pain, not simply how you get injured or treated. For example, whether you can access medical care or the way in which you express your pain may depend on your ethnicity, race, culture, gender, personality traits, medical history, mental wellbeing, and many, many factors, as you've seen here,

37:31
Mary: let's consider race compared to older white adult compared to older white adults, older black adults report higher rates of chronic pain, pain conditions while reporting on their pain less often. Again, this kind of goes back to like the different understanding on social socialization around seeking medical care. For example, older black adults face more challenges in receiving pain management and healthcare services they need. Also, there's a higher mistrust towards healthcare providers, along with a lack of cultural sensitivity care and financial barriers that may make it difficult to give quality care. And then let's consider physical mobility. Pain can make people want to rest, not walk or avoid activities because you don't want to like exacerbate the pain too much rest can make us feel guilty sluggish, or like we're falling behind. We get down on ourselves, and the pain gets worse. And then, when you might try to make up for lost time, you like, do too much and then, but then, like, pushing too hard can cause more pain and in time become less effective,

38:39
Mary: as well as, like making you less active, more frustrated, stressed or even or even stuck.

38:53
Mary: Okay. And then, with regards to chronic pain treatments, because of multiple factors contributing to chronic pain. There's not one size fits all model for managing chronic pain. Instead, individuals with chronic pain often require multiple forms of treatment. For example, there's like medications over the counter, prescription medications that can provide temporary relief, physical therapy and exercise. While short rest periods can be helpful. Regular exercise is crucial for building mobility and strength.

39:25
Mary: Alternate therapy, such as like oral medication, traditional healing methods, such as acupuncture, massages can alleviate pain as well. For example, you know, using ginger or turmeric and dietary practices and also provide anti inflammatory benefits. I know for me, when I get like, sick or get a cold, I'm always like, ginger, lemon, garlic. That's always my go to so like things like that, as well as behavioral treatments, such as like cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation, tell people cope with.

40:00
Mary: their pain and improve overall emotional well being.

40:07
Mary: I know that Brenda also has something in the chat. Do you want to like say that?

40:15
Brenda: Yes, I feel that,

40:19
Brenda: for me personally,

40:22
Brenda: I have a lot of chronic pain, and I have been given

40:27
Brenda: a prescription for Percocet's to take as needed, and however, the way the doctor gives them to me is so different from the way I have spoken to my friends that are I'm white. They they might get, like 120 pills for, I don't know how long, but I usually, my doctor usually gives me 20 pills, and he will not

40:57
Brenda: refill it until five months. So to me, that's like torture. I mean that it's just, I mean, it's just, I don't know.

41:16
Mary: Yeah, thank you so much for sharing, and I'm so sorry to hear that I do know, like, you know I'm not a doctor myself, so maybe Tony can offer more insight on that area.
Tony: Yeah, I appreciate you. You're bringing that up. I think the term polypharmacy often comes up when we are trying to manage very complex medical conditions, whether it's chronic pain or even depression, which this program also addresses, I think that one of the goals of this program is not removing medications, but perhaps optimizing them so that we don't require as much. And I also recognize, like as you're suggesting, that sometimes it's not even up to the patient. It's almost like the doctor is kind of throwing stuff, and then you get this laundry list of medications, but still, in the in the event that that's not the case, but it's more like you're trying to figure out which medications work for you,

42:15
Tony: this program does offer an opportunity to bring in some coping skills, some relaxation exercises and some community

42:26
Tony: building, so that people have other forms of relief that could decrease their reliance on certain medications. Again, really not trying to stigmatize medications, but just offering ways for people to kind of make their treatments overall more holistic, so spread out across not just medications, but behavioral techniques too, which this program will focus on, hopefully, that kind of helps

42:55
Tony: kind of clarify how we might intersect with that very tricky medical situation.

43:01
Mary: Thank you so much for that. Tony,

43:05
Mary: moving on here,

43:07
Mary: understanding

43:10
Mary: like, what is the relationship between chronic pain and emotional wellbeing? As you know, for this manual, specifically it is for chronic pain and mood

43:22
Mary: and so the relationship between chronic pain and emotional wellbeing does not simply flow in one direction. Your emotional wellbeing may influence chronic pain, and your influence your chronic pain, and chronic pain may influence your emotional wellbeing. And as you guys have, we had talked about earlier, some people had mentioned that they were in pain, and so that influenced their mood. So we're seeing that happen in real time. For example, chronic pain can get in the way of work, family commitment, which can be very, very frustrating, and then, like, the extra baggage on top of the pain can make the pain feel even more worse and exacerbate it.

44:02
Mary: Okay,

44:07
Nomin: okay, so I'll just go through this case study. So within the introduction and honestly within the sessions as well, we want to bring in different forms of thinking, so audios, recordings, but also passages, quotes, and in this case, a case study of Linda, who is not a real person, but could resonate with a lot of people's

44:31
Nomin: stories. Linda enjoys going for long walks with her grandkids one day, however, a car unexpectedly collides with her. She has recovered from this car accident. However, since she has experienced chronic pain in her shoulder, despite multiple medical workout workups, doctors were not able to pinpoint why she has continued to experience chronic pain. They were, however, able to rule out life threatening causes such as cancer. Regardless, she has continued.

45:00
Nomin: To worry about why her shoulder pain has not gone away to the point of losing sleep. She now has trouble planning out her life, and no longer goes on walks as she used to. She now notices a significant drop in her physical functioning and quality of life. Her pain also feels worse at this point. She now feels hopeless over whether she will ever get better. And incorporating things like this, we want to bring in personal stories from folks,

45:29
Nomin: maybe give space for one or two people to share about similar experiences, and kind of build community between each other, just because, yes, we are joining this program to help ourselves, but also find a community with people who share the same life experiences could be very important. And I was wondering What's everyone's thoughts on this, and if they would want something similar?

46:07
Vicki: okay. I was trying to

46:11
Vicki: to understand what you were saying, because I was reading and reading along with about Linda's case, and it made me think about my case, because my pain started, I was working, I was driving bus for the handicap,

46:30
Vicki: and the pain kept hitting me in my legs and my feet, and I kept going back and forth to the doctors, and they told me that I had gout,

46:42
Vicki: and then nothing was helping the pain, nothing that gave me physical therapy. Nothing was helping it at all. I had to do a nuts and more tests, and I came up. I had lupus and fibromyalgia.

47:01
Vicki: I've been going through this pain. I am 66 now, and I've been going through this pain since I've been 24

47:10
Vicki: and at 26 with me still continuing trying to work,

47:18
Vicki: I had to stop working, and I haven't been able to work since because between the lupus and the fibromyalgia turning brown and experience congestive heart failure,

47:33
Vicki: and I'm on a lot of medication, and I'm tired of taking so much medication, and I've been trying to do some meditation and little exercise. I can't walk that much because it starts my heart rate, and I'm having a hard time. And I just sometimes I feel,

48:00
Vicki: what can I get or do with this pain? This pain is making me depressed.

48:07
Vicki: I'm a mother of four kids and a grandmother 10, and I don't get to spend much time doing anything with them because of my health,

48:20
Vicki: so it bothers me, but that's how my life is.

48:27
Tony: Thank you for sharing that

48:30
Tony: I admit some of the conditions you mentioned, the lupus, the fibromyalgia, that can be tricky to treat. You know, whether it's the steroid treatments for the lupus, which can have side effects,

48:42
Tony: the, you know, the medications like Cymbalta for fibromyalgia, which themselves can also have side effects, but they're very effective. It's just it can be tricky finding the one that works, and sometimes

48:55
Tony: we don't find like a perfect medication regimen. And so the reason I'm bringing this up is because one, one aspect of this program is how we're not principally focused on actually addressing the pain. It's almost how we continue to live our lives in spite of the pain, and perhaps even increasing our mindfulness of the pain so that we can figure out when we are reacting in a way that doesn't help us cope with it, thinking about ways to relax through relaxation exercises, increasing our mobility so that we don't have our muscles deconditioned, and hopefully, through these factors improve the pain, although it's not guaranteed, but a lot of it's figuring out ways to continue living life as we once even though the pain conditions are ongoing and like

49:51
Tony: 24 so like that. So I bring this up just because I am curious about what y'all think about a program that doesn't focus on.

50:00
Tony: Pain as the first thing to decrease, but more improving our lives around chronic pain.

50:09
Timothy: I could say that

50:12
Timothy: I've been dealing with, you know, pain, usually in the knees, but more recently and often in the back also, but I have not sought medications because my earlier experience with is

50:28
Timothy: they kind of debilitating, you know, I don't like side effects, you know.

50:35
Timothy: Hello,

50:37
Tony: we can hear you.
Timothy:  Oh, okay, yeah. So I don't like the side effects. So, you know, I generally just try, like, when it gets to deal or,

50:49
Timothy: you know, pretty you know, then I just find ways to try and release it, you know, eat or just lay down and rest or whatever. But I try to keep functioning. I just try and keep going. I have to, you know, you know,

51:06
Timothy: there's

51:08
Timothy: no option,

51:12
Timothy: but, yeah, I do try and get better because of

51:18
Timothy: change the side effects is too much for

51:22
Timothy: me, so that's

51:27
Timothy: what it seemed like most of the pain meds do to me.
Nadine: Hello,

51:35
Nadine: hello. This is Nadine. Can you confirm to me that you can hear me?
Tony: Yes, ma'am,

51:42
Nadine: you can hear me, okay, my, my, what I like to say is that I am resigned to the fact that I have this pain. I have both knee pains. I had a knee replacement. I fell down and fractured my shoulder, so that's healed. However, I still have pain. I have spinal pain, so I'm resigned to the fact that I'm going to live with pain,

52:04
Nadine: or have pain, like you were saying, I would like to find ways to be get motivated in ways to just try to do as much as I can possibly do in a day without thinking about the pain. That's what my issue is.

52:20
Nadine: You know,
Tony: I appreciate you sharing that, and that is actually maybe a central goal of this program, and so I'm glad that that's something folks might be interested in working towards,

52:33
Nadine: really and truly. I would,

52:37
Tony: yeah.

52:40
Tony: Why don't we, for the interest of time, move on to the next slide. But if anyone has thoughts about this that come up later, feel free to interrupt and chime in again.

52:50
Mary: Thank you, everyone so much for sharing your experiences. We truly appreciate it, and just kind of like moving on here, this is another graphic that we have,

53:03
Mary: it's kind of like helping us better understand our pain alert and how it presents. So just hear you seeing like the pain alert and like the thoughts that may come from

53:15
Mary: feeling that pain and then the feelings and then the action. And this is what this pattern or thinking, right? What we would consider, like the downward spiral, and then we'll definitely, like edit it up a bit. But here you see, like, you have the pain alert, and then your thoughts may be, oh, I'm a bummer to be around because my pain and memory. So that's how like pain impacting your mood. Other people might have to accommodate me. So like, you know, feeling like a burden, not wanting to feel like a burden on others, and the feelings that might come from that is like, maybe embarrassed, my guilt, frustration, and then actions

53:50
Mary: could be like withdrawing from certain activities, self isolating, and so just kind of having that downward spiral. And so this is another one of our graphics where we're just trying to definitely illustrate those points

54:05
Mary: actually. Like, what do you guys think of this so far? Like, do you feel like that really helps like

54:11
Mary: describe and like explain that downward spiral for you guys, I

54:25
Brenda: it.

54:27
Brenda: I think it does. It's

54:30
Brenda: good graphics. And when I think about my pain and how it evolves, it

54:38
Brenda: really think it is. It's pretty good.

54:43
Thank you so much.

54:45
Dorothy: Because when you look at like a picture of the different things, it's kind of easier to been reading a book, because you get more understanding from, you know, like a diagraph or something.

54:57
Mary: Mm,

54:58
Mary: definitely what I am hearing

55:00
Mary: is that like for the manual itself, definitely having as many graphics as possible, explaining those concepts would be better than just kind of like having a lot of text.
Dorothy: Yeah.

55:11
Mary: Alright. Thank you so much for that, for that point of feedback. We'll definitely put that under consideration and then just moving on here again, additional like preventing additional chronic pain, burden and suffering.

55:27
Mary: If we target the disability spiral by default, we also target the pain that's in this program. We want to place you, the person living with pain, firmly and powerfully in the driver's seat, so that we can recognize when you are caught in the downward spiral and actively reverse gears into what we call the upward spiral, which you'll see a little bit later as part of the upward spiral. We learn how your thoughts affect your feelings, your behaviors and your pain, as you had seen a little bit ago, as well, how to focus your attention and be in the moment, how to become aware of and deal with the thoughts and feelings that come as a result, how to work with stress and pain so that it causes less suffering. You will learn other skills to cope with your chronic pain, as well as part of being on the program, such as how to practice meditation and how to recognize difficult situations early on and how to best respond, and then when you move along the upper spiral, we do not aim to eliminate chronic pain from our lives. Instead, we aim to recenter our focus and accept our chronic pain without judgment, by non judgmentally gazing at our pain. We also learn to live our lives as we once did, this includes feeling more happy, satisfied with our lives, improving our physical functioning, or perhaps even increasing our tolerance for pain.

56:51
Mary: And

56:53
Mary: so this is the upward spiral that we're thinking about again. We'll edit it a little bit so that it benefits the manual. So here we're like, or our goal is less pain, less memory challenges again, don't worry about it. We'll definitely fix it, update it, and then it's like our new thoughts would be now I know how to like, maybe like walk and like walking is not bad for me. It's actually good for me, even though I experienced some discomfort initially. And that feeling that we get might be like, okay, like you are feeling yourself, push yourself a little bit, and then you're getting excited, you're feeling motivated, and then you actions might be that, like you are becoming more active, right? Like not staying at home, not isolating, and that can improve your overall mood as well.

57:49
Nadine: If I could just add one more thing in regards to the pain since that fall twice, and as a result of that, you know, had a fractured shoulder one time. I injured, injured my back, and I have the pain, I think at some point down the line, maybe if you can address the fear of falling, because the reason I sometimes don't want to get up and go outside is because if I fall, I'm going to have to go through that, go through pain. I'm going to have to go to the hospital. If I fracture something, I'm going to have to go to rehab. So I know that's like an additional piece to it, but I know that's one thing because of my fear of the pain, or having the pain, which I'm willing to accept at my age, but then to be active and you run the risk of falling,

58:35
Nadine: the whole pain thing comes right back into mind. So you know that would be something, you know, down the line, maybe,

58:43
Mary: definitely, definitely, that is such a great point. Thank you so much for bringing that up. Like, again, like, we really want you, like, with that idea of, like, being more physically active, it's like getting that strength. Also, we understand that, like, there's definitely that fear, and like, finding different ways to to address that fear as well.

59:05
Mary: And then here we just have some like quotes as well as we kind of like go through everything as you see, says you have a full and interesting life. Chronic pain does not have to overshadow all aspects of your daily life. So like having some, centering different quotes within the manual that are over encouragement. Now we'll talk about a few of them later on as well. And so far, like this is like, what session one will be like? I mean, like the introduction. What do you guys think so far in terms of, like, the content that we've presented? Yeah,

59:55
Mary: no pressure at all to share. I think you guys have shared so far. I.

1:00:00
Mary: Um, but like, if anything comes up, definitely, like, put in the chat or, like, you can also, like, speak. I don't know if I heard someone, um, wants to, like, share.

1:00:09
Nadine: Oh, well, I can't, I can't see the visuals on my phone, so I'm just going by,  what you are telling me. So maybe in a later date I could do the visuals, and then maybe I can share some. But so far, I think everything addresses what I know I would be interested in.

1:00:26
Mary: Absolutely. Thank you so much for that. Now, going into session one, which is like the orientation and introductions, getting to know each other, what you've already done, but like, again, getting to know each other, icebreaker, Introduction to mindfulness and overall program. So this is what would be such a one for the manual itself on the program.

1:00:47
Mary: Let me see here in the chat, we have something

1:00:52
Mary: awesome. Thank you so much, Blanca and like, as Tony had mentioned a little while ago, we'll definitely going to like have a workbook so that for those who you feel like, that will be better, it will help you better. Like, pace yourself will be available to you as well during the program, group introductions, again, we'll have group introduction icebreakers, where everybody introduces themselves, just so we kind of get to know each other as well as like setting expectations will be part of session one where they're like communicating that you're we're there for you, we're there for each other, listening careful and responding with empathy, even if there's disagreement. So like a sense of respect for everyone involved active participation in discussions and activities, but like no pressure to participate. Just do as much as you're comfortable with. It's okay to take things at your own pace, but the more you engage, the more you will get from the experience. We'll definitely like share this with the group. What is shared within the group stays within the group again, respecting people like vulnerability with us as well. That's really, really important. Again, respecting each other, understanding each other and caring for each other as well.

1:02:10
Mary: What is mindfulness and how can it help? Again, introducing mindfulness. Mindfulness is about noticing whatever experience we're having, including any thoughts, feelings or physical sensations that may arise in a given moment. Many of our reactions to stressful events seem to happen automatically, meaning we may not be aware of them, and they seem to unfold without choosing but these automatic reactions can increase our distress, so definitely introducing that concept of mindfulness. And so how do I become more mindful? It

1:02:44
Mary: is important to understand that mindfulness is not just a destination or something to achieve. Rather, mindfulness is a practice, something you continuously do, something we engage in with our minds and bodies and over and over again, so that this skill is available to us when we most needed when we're in those moments of pain. One way to practice mindfulness is through meditation. This may not be as hard as you may think. I know when you think meditation, some people think about yoga, but meditation is setting aside a chunk of time to practice being mindful, focusing on what you're thinking about in that moment, a mindful meditation practice often done sitting with eyes closed, but can also be done laying down or even walking. You can use audios to guide you through your own pace. You don't need peaceful mountains, you know, as the media might show us, and you don't need to practice at a certain you don't need to practice at a certain religion or at all, so like meditation and mindfulness, another important way to practice mindfulness is informal practice, or just simply bringing mindfulness to your daily activities. You can do this

1:03:58
Mary: routine actively, like being mindful, let's say like you're washing dishes decision, being mindful eating, focusing on what you're eating, the different tastes, without taking any extra time. And so in this program, you learn these practices, and you will be encouraged to practice them daily, just like with physical exercise, this is the best way to strengthen your mindfulness muscle so that you can get as much of it, as much out of it, as possible, as well as like, help you face any stresses, stresses that come about. And the mindfulness can also look like praying, right? And I don't know, for me, like, there's a lot of us in this room that, like, maybe it might be Christians, like, praying is also mindfulness. It just kind of looks a little bit different, right? And then here, sprinkled within the manual, will definitely have like, different quotes, like you see here, different words of encouragement, making make sure you weave your parachute every day, rather than leave it to the time you have to jump out of the plane. I definitely.

1:05:00
Mary: Definitely, we're also looking for any feedback on other quotes or words of encouragement that may better resonate with you guys and like the community, and I know sometimes, like, we may not know who these authors are within the community. And so like, if you maybe like a Maya Angelou

1:05:19
quote or like at MLK, what will be better? So like, what do you guys think so far?

1:05:28
Nadine: Oh, that sounds great to me. Good.

1:05:35
Mary: Awesome. Thank you so much.

1:05:42
Mary: Okay. And just moving on here,

1:05:46
Mary: this is a program so you will learn within this session like switching automatic pilot to awareness and intention, avoidance to curiosity and acceptance, thinking about and then directly experiencing, judging and fixating, switching it to observing, reacting, switching it to responding unhealthy habits and switching that to taking care of ourselves.

1:06:15
Mary: Awesome. Thank you so much, Leah, for that. I would definitely want to like have as many like affirmations as possible to encourage people as they're going through this program,

1:06:27
Mary: increasing engagement. And so, as we had mentioned previously, like we're planning on having like videos as part of the manual audio recordings to guide you through practices having the manual accessible in different format, whether like it's given to you physically or like you could find it in person. Um,

1:06:49
Mary: so like, I guess I just want to get as much of your feedback on these areas, like looking at these questions. What are some responses that you feel like would would work best for you?

1:07:08
Nadine: Oh, I'm sorry, what works best for me? I got distracted.

1:07:12
Mary: No worries. It's kind of like looking at these questions, right? Do you feel like, how would you feel about having like, a video recording for the introduction to the techniques, instead of maybe, like reading it right, or maybe having both as an option for you,

1:07:32
Leah: I would like,

1:07:34
Leah: I would like a recording so we could refer to it back.

1:07:41
Leah: You know, saying a website too, the access to menu so we could go, you know, refer to it more than one time,

1:07:53
Mary: definitely. Thank you so much. We just want to make it as accessible to everyone, as much as possible. And again, with, I think we had spoken about the physical location a little earlier, just making sure that it's within an area where, like this public transportation and it's accessible. And then when, when we think about the day of the week of having this program, are there certain days that will work best for people than others.

1:08:26
Nadine: From the magazine, any day is fine.

1:08:30
Vicki: Any day is fine with me too.

1:08:38
Mary: Awesome, definitely. Thank you so much for that. I know there's some people in previous groups I'd mentioned, like, oh, the weekend might work a little bit better than like, during the week. What do you guys think about that?

1:08:53
Vicki: Yes,

1:08:58
Nadine: during the week. Thank you so

1:09:01
Mary: thank you so much for that. And what about the terms that we've said, like chronic pain? I know we had mentioned that this chronic pain and mood study, but also focus on depression, mindfulness meditation. So are there any these terms are concerning to you in any way?

1:09:28
Nadine: you're asking about any additional concerns, or just this list, just yeah, this list, or any terms that we've said previously. Are there any life concerns that you have, any words that are making you feel a little bit achy, and who wouldn't appreciate seeing them?

1:09:45
Nadine: Oh no, I'm fine with the list. Thanks. Fine for me.

1:09:50
Vicki: I am to the chronic pain, the depression, all of it.

1:09:56
Vicki: Yeah, yeah.

1:10:00
Mary: Alright. Thank you so much everyone for speaking. And I know some people in the chat had mentioned that possibly having the program happening in the evening instead of like in the morning. So that's thank you so much for that. Something we'll definitely put in our feedback folder in our minds. And so these are some of the audio recordings that we're thinking of being part of. Emmanuel actually, like in a little bit, ask you to kind of listen to a recording, give us your feedback on it. So again, like my walking, my movement, body scan and like different meditation practices, and we're planning on having this be part of the program itself, so that you have the writing as well as, like the audio versions. And I know some people had mentioned that would be really good to have both to help people better understand this concepts.

1:11:02
Vicki: That I like this

1:11:07
Mary: awesome. Thank you so much for that.

1:11:12
Mary: And so what I'm going to do now is that there is this, like, five minute mindful, mindful walking audio that would love your feedback on. So I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do is kind of like, take the link from YouTube and put it in the chat, and if you can,

1:11:36
Mary: if you can, please, like, navigate to YouTube and try to, like, maybe, like, take about seven minutes where you could just, like, listen to the recording itself and give us your feedback once you're done. How does that sound for people

1:11:57
Nadine: you don't want us to do that?

1:12:00
Mary: Oh, no, you could do it right now. Actually, y'all give us about, like, seven ish minutes.

1:12:06
Nadine: Okay, I'll try.

1:12:09
All right.

1:12:12
Mary: Like, I gonna put the link in the chat, so if you could, like, click on it.

1:12:19
Tony: Okay, let us know if you run into any issues, but it should just open up, like a YouTube app or your browser. You can just play it right there. And once you're done, you can go back into the Zoom meeting. No worries, too. If you have to, like, leave the zoom and Come back, we can just let you Back In.

1:12:33
Okay?

1:15:30
I know some people are just kind of having, like, a hard time with it, so let me see if I could possibly share it. I'm not sure if people are able to

1:15:41
able to, like, navigate,

1:15:45
so

1:15:47
I don't think anyone can hear that. Correct,

1:15:50
having a hard time. I could just play it for like, five seconds.

1:16:01
No, can't hear it, unfortunately.

1:16:06
Maybe see here, it's okay. Honestly, maybe we can just get feedback from those who were able to listen to it and kind of

1:16:16
cut our losses. I think we might have to kind of troubleshoot this next time with the whole audio thing.

1:16:25
Oh, okay, thanks.

1:16:29
Sorry about that. Everyone.

1:16:40
Okay, so what again, was anyone able to listen to the audio, possibly and provide any feedback and insights on it?

1:16:56
Brenda: I got it. You just had to turn up the volume. It was very low, but after I turned up the volume, I could hear

1:17:08
her.

1:17:29
Brenda: And were you able to listen to a little bit of it?

1:17:34
Brenda: Yes, I could. I listened to it.

1:17:38
Brenda: It was good. I've done it before, but it was good, you know, she was

1:17:45
Brenda: talking about,

1:17:47
Brenda: you know, just kind of letting your body relax and feeling your feet on the ground or the floor and how to navigate through, how to navigate through that to

1:18:03
make yourself feel good calm.

1:18:07
Tony: And you know when you when you reflect on what it was like hearing
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: that parallel to each other, your weight evenly distributed?

1:18:20
Mary: Was anyone able to hear that? Yeah, that worked, actually. Yes,

1:18:25
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: your knees unlocked and flexing slightly. Okay,

1:18:29
Mary: so maybe we can listen to like, a minute or so of it, and then we can discuss quickly

1:18:37
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: and hold your hands gently in front of your body. It's mindful walking meditation.

1:18:43
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: Position yourself so that you are standing with your back straight but not stiff,

1:18:50
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: starting with your feet parallel to each other, your weight evenly distributed,

1:18:57
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: your knees unlocked and flexing slightly

1:19:02
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: and hold your hands gently in front of your body or loosely by your sides,

1:19:09
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: allowing your eyes to be open, gazing along your path to a point about two yards ahead, not looking at anything In particular, just a soft awareness so you remain on your path and know when to turn

1:19:27
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: and just taking a moment to form an intention for this period of practice that feels right for you,

1:19:36
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: and when you are ready, bringing your attention to your body standing in stillness

1:19:44
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: where your feet make contact with the floor or the ground,

1:19:49
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: the weight of your body being held by your legs and feet,

1:19:54
Mindfulness 5min audio recording: it may help to rock slightly forward and back and side to side.

1:20:00
Odd a few times.

1:20:02
Mary: Okay, so what does everyone think about like just listening to a little bit of the audio?

1:20:14
Tony: Feel free to give feedback on like, the way it was delivered, even not just simply the content, but like, the voicing, the pacing of this,

1:20:24
Mary: the content

1:20:28
Timothy: that doesn't do much for me, oh yeah, tell me. Oh, it doesn't do like, it doesn't do much for me, yeah, yeah, dude, yeah, I've tried it. I've tried it before that, you know, tried listening to this series like I have tried it, listening to a few meditations and

1:20:46
Timothy: that type of thing. But, yeah,

1:20:49
Timothy: I don't think anyone could talk you through that.

1:20:53
Timothy: No, I don't think
Tony: Could you tell us more about what about it like didn't work through maybe
Timothy: I think it is just like, I think it's just, I think it's just the way that I take things in, you know, and that's never been my most comfortable way to doing it, you know, okay, where you know someone's dictating how, you know, like, what, that's why I've never been really successful.
Tony: Do you think it would help if the person talking was a bit more animated in their voice,

1:21:25
Timothy: I think that would defeat the surface or the purpose to calm

1:21:30
Timothy: you down or make sure you don't get too animated or excited.
Tony: You know, I think that we're

1:21:38
Tony: definitely trying to reinterpret what it what it means to listen to a recording. I think typically they do sound like that. I do know people kind of get

1:21:50
Tony: more benefit from the recording when there is a bit more like emotion in the voice, even more animated.

1:21:57
Tony: So it's kind of a tricky kind of middle ground that we'd like to hit where, you know, we're not trying to test people out too much, but we're also not wanting people to completely zone out for that recording, right?
Timothy: Yeah, and I tend to zone out my

1:22:16
Timothy: personal experience,

1:22:19
Timothy: and I'm gonna be muted for most of the rest of it because I'm in a different situation.

1:22:28
Timothy: But I'm listening. I am listening.

1:22:32
Tony: What about the time? Length? You know, I know some folks have had opinions about how long these recordings should be per listening. And you can see here they're like, five minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes.

1:22:45
Tony: Are some of those too short, too long? What are your thoughts in terms of like, people's attention when it comes to being able to listen to a recording and guide them along? A certain practice?

1:22:58
Vicki: I think it depends on how the recording is?

1:23:06
Tony: I see 20 minutes,

1:23:09
Tony: 30 Okay, gotcha.

1:23:12
Brenda: Yeah, I think like 20 minutes is for me personally, I think 20 minutes is about enough,

1:23:22
Brenda: because, and I did like the

1:23:26
Brenda: voice of the person and the way it was being delivered.

1:23:32
Brenda: And it really is

1:23:34
Brenda: a personal thing. Some people like it. Some people don't, and it can be too long or too short. And I think by doing it,

1:23:45
Brenda: you know, just going through it sometimes helps you to understand what's what's enough for you, how much you can can take and and how is it affecting you? Is it helping you to relax and be able to go through your body and try to get rid of pain, you know, try to kind of control it. It sounds funny, but it's it. For me, it works sometimes.

1:24:17
Tony: Gotcha.

1:24:19
Tony: Another thought I had while listening is

1:24:24
Tony: 20, 30 minutes could work.

1:24:27
Tony: Some people in the past have also said, like, oh, like, Max five minutes. And I'm curious what people think if one were to kind of break up these 20 or 45 minute clips into like, five minute segments so that they're like, bite sized versions of the audio recording. Or do you feel like five minutes is like way too short to practice something?

1:24:53
Tony: Okay, I see that Ms Lanka just said too short.

1:24:57
Brenda:: Yeah, I agree that's too short. I.

1:25:00
Brenda: You mean, it takes a few minutes to get in the, you know, to kind of get into the mood or to feel it, yeah,

1:25:09
Tony: gotcha,

1:25:12
Tony: okay, um, I know we're at the 2:30 mark. If others have thoughts on this, feel free to chime in. But Mary, do you think we could switch over to the like the name slide, and then go back to like, the worksheets and stuff, if we have more time.

1:25:30
Mary: Yeah, definitely. So with regards to the names, so we are also like, currently, also like thinking of like, different ways to name the program that best resonates with the community, something that's like, relatable. So these are some of our ideas and different ideas that other people from the other focus groups kind of came up with. I would also appreciate any ideas that you guys have in terms of what we can name it something catchy, something memorable.

1:26:03
Mary: So, yeah, a nice acronym. Yeah, I love a good acronym as well. So, yeah,

1:26:11
Mary: so far, we've been calling it the quiet focus also this idea of like feeling of being, maybe Mind- Body

1:26:22
Mary: presence pulse, hoping and coping, like just different different names. Happy to get your feedback on any of these names I see here, or just any, any new ideas that you guys have,
Tony:  just because I recognize some people here might not be able to see the screen. Mary, could you just kind of read the like,

1:26:46
Tony: the names, the the names on the list, and if it's like an acronym, just say the acronym?

1:26:52
Mary: Yeah, absolutely. So the names are quiet focus, feeling of being , CC Mind Body, community culture Mind-Body, bbcc which is breath body community and culture, culture community Mind Body, community and health connection, cultural and personal well being, presence pulse,

1:27:19
being matters, sense of self study, living with pain, living through pain, mindfulness head to toe, pain go, hoping and coping, a feeling of healing. Those are some of the needs that we have.

1:27:38
Tony: And feel free to chime in with any other ideas you might have, because we are definitely open minded about it.

1:27:48
Tony: Oh, I see some votes for hoping and coping. Do others have any favorites here?
Brenda: I

1:28:05
Brenda; I like hoping and coping also. I also like living through pain, because I feel that that's kind of what we're going to have to do, especially for us that have chronic pain, we're going to have it, but we have to live through it.

1:28:32
Tony: Other thoughts, you can even say names that you don't like on this list, so we can know never to use it. I

1:28:40
uh,

1:28:49
Tony: also, um, open to just like in general, like, what do you think works as a name for a program? Like, oh? Like, when I look for a program, I need a program that just says what we're going to like a maybe some people prefer a program with a name that's kind of catchy, even if it might not capture everything.

1:29:08
Tony: Yeah.

1:29:18
Miguel: How you doing? Tony, can you hear me? Yeah. Hey, what's up? Jesus Christ, I just saw the

1:29:25
Miguel: the text. Oh, okay, and I just, and I just zoomed in,
Tony:  yeah, uh, thanks for coming. Actually, we're in the process of,

1:29:36
Miguel: I'm late, yeah,
Tony: yeah, bit, bit, but it's okay. Um, might have talked about that later, but we're just talking about names for this program right now. So if you see like, a a name here that like

1:29:49
Tony: that kind of resonates with you,

1:29:52
Tony: feel free to give us your feedback. And then, you know, honestly, like I was saying to Mr. Timmy, we are definitely interested.


FG5_3_last 30min
Tue, Dec 10, 2024 9:34AM • 40:33

00:00
Tony: Your feedback. And then, you know, honestly, like I was saying to Mr. Timmy, we are definitely interested in names that work both for people who are women and men. So thinking about, like, just in general, if you were to consider someone else, person of color, who's a guy, if there are particular names here that might resonate with them for a program that is about, you know, teaching skills about mindfulness and meditation for chronic pain and depression.

00:30
Miguel:  Okay, so you want me to put some input in this?
Tony: Oh, yeah, just read it. See if there's a name

00:36
Tony: and Mr. Timmy, yeah, if you can hear this too, we'd love your input. You

00:44
uh,

00:49
Miguel: well, that quiet focus one there, right? That first one,

00:54
Tony: yeah, that's the kind of code name we use for this intervention in the beginning. But we're actually okay to pivot from it. I just noticed that you brought it up for simplicity when we are well,
Miguel: quiet. Focus for me is, is that what you trying to say? Like, how would I feel about these things? Tony: So these are just like names for the program. And so if you were

01:19
Miguel: to as I got you,
Tony: yeah,if you think about that's a name for a program that works. That's not a name for a program that works.

01:29
Miguel: Quiet, focus is a good one, though.

01:32
Miguel: Let's see sense of self study. Yeah, sense of self study doesn't sound bad, either.

01:40
Miguel: Living with pain, living through pain. There's a lot of good ones,

01:45
Miguel: hoping and coping a feeling of healing, a feeling of healing. That sounds good, too.

01:52
Miguel: You came up with these. We all did, in a way, like I

01:57
Tony: did, even others from previous groups did.

02:00
Mary: Yeah, it definitely feels like okay, go ahead. No, no, go ahead.

02:06
Miguel: Okay, so I'm saying you, you, you want us to choose which one is good?

02:13
Tony: Yeah, or just even give your general feedback. Sounds like we heard from you a few ones that sounded okay. I did, I did, and I forgot what it was. Oh, it's okay. We we're recording this meeting, so we'll have it written down.

02:25
Nomin: If you have any suggestions for any names to feel free to write it down or tell us to

02:32
Miguel: Yeah,
May: you can even give us a call. Yeah, give us a call. Give us an email. We're we're always here for that as well. It definitely seems like the shorter the better in terms of, like remembering. But yeah,
Miguel: that's why I said quiet focus is is a short one,

02:51
Miguel: so that that's kind of well, I kind of like this one right here. I like, I like

02:57
Miguel: a feeling of healing or hoping and coping.

03:01
Miguel: That sounds good.
Tony: Okay, sounds like we like some rhyme schemes going on,
Miguel: yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes it, makes it sound good.

03:09
Tony: Cool. Well, Mary, why don't you go unless you had some other comments you wanted to make, we can go back to talking about, like the home practice stuff and source materials,

03:21
Mary: absolutely, and also, Leah also put in the chat the name all of us as well. That's actually a really, really good one, kind of showing that unity. So thank you so much for that. And so just gonna go back a little bit here, since we had jumped ahead. And so,

03:40
Mary: in addition to like the the audios also have the materials for the program is just like home practice, right? So as you're in the session, then you're learning about these like skills. You also want you to be able to like, take it home and practice them, because practice makes better, right? Practice makes better. And so the more you engage with the material, the more you practice it, the more you're able to really kind of utilize it when you really, really need it, in those moments of pain and like, and recall it a little bit better. So this is one of our worksheets where it's like a home practice exercise, or it's like mindful eating. This week as you did in sessions, bring awareness to the sensations of like, the taste of your food, the site of it, the smell of it, the feel of it as you're eating. Hopefully, have some seasoning, you know, beyond salt and pepper. So there's also that also, like, notice your thoughts, emotions and behaviors while you're like, eating. You know when something is good and you're quiet and you really know it's that good. Like, notice that that feeling, what does that feel like? Or if you make a sound, notice that sound, and also take you know, like when you have those moments, writing it down in this worksheet here, like your sensations, your thoughts, your emotions and behaviors and urges as you're like mindful eating.

05:00
Mary:  We also have, like, the body scan meditation each day this week, we say, like, starting the day for like, for example, like this will be in like session two, find a place where you can lie down comfortably without being disturbed, and then follow the instruction on, like an audio, right? We'd be like a worksheet and an audio pair together. And so as you're going through the audio, like, write down a few notes about what you notice again, your sensations, your thoughts, your feelings, your behaviors that came from that activity, as well as like, rate your awareness of judgment, of your experiences. And then another worksheet here we have is like mindfulness of a daily routine activity is like choosing a different activity that you can do at least once a week, and then we'll definitely give you like another handout, just to give you more examples and more direction and as best as you can practice the awareness of your physical sensation, thoughts, emotions and behaviors while you're doing like daily activity, it could really be like cooking, washing the dishes, watching like your grandkids, like just being more mindful of what you do so you can be in the moment and noting that down. So what do you what do you think so far about like, these kind of worksheets, and if they will be helpful to you as someone who could possibly be going through the program?

06:23
Miguel: That to me,

06:26
Miguel: everyone you can, like, write your feedback as well. Yeah,

06:30
Brenda: it would be helpful for me. I like, I like that idea, um, and I was just trying to see how we will be able to get this. How we do we copy this? Are you going to, you know, email it to us? How are we going to be able to fill it out?

06:49
Mary: That's a good so, so you want to be filling it out as part of the this focus group today, but like as part of the intervention, when you're participating in intervention like this, will definitely be part of the manual that you're given and the materials that you're given as well. Sorry for interrupting. I think Tony wanted to see something.
Tony: No, you nailed it. That's exactly what I was going to say. And we are also open to different ways to fill these exercises out, because we really want to make it so that it doesn't get in the way of your life, but it's something that you kind of might enjoy doing in between sessions. And so, you know, you could think of these practices as being done on pen and paper, and we could print them out for you. We could also maybe even make it like a form that you could fill out on the web, like through the website.

07:39
Tony: You could even consider this program having like a process where you can call someone up in the program and kind of walk through it together, and kind of have some almost like a, like a buddy outside of the session, who's, you know, part of the program, who you can talk to in the phone and say, like, Hey, just wanted to walk through the sheet with you, and you can share your own individual experiences, the sensations, the thoughts and so forth. Yeah, just curious what, what people might think would make these exercises more engaging and more likely to be completed by folks who go through this program.

08:21
Dorothy: I have a hard time filling out stuff, on, on, on computer, even signing my name. So I mean, that seems a little hard. I'm not that computer savvy, yet I

08:36
Miguel: feel the same way.

08:38
Vicki: I'm not good with the computer either?

08:48
Mary: Yeah, definitely. Thank you so much, everyone. Again, I just want to make this as accessible to everybody as possible. That's why we're exploring like audios and videos and like having a website, but also like having a printed out version, so that people are able to access it in multiple different forms, in multiple different ways,

09:08
as you go through the program,

09:12
print out will be good, definitely.

09:16
Mary: Thank you so much everyone for your

09:20
Mary: insights. Just moving on here. Another thing that we have talked about previously is like having like different quotes and different patch passages, just to like as a way to like, kind of like guide us through other materials, also like sources of encouragement. Here, there is like this quote where it's like this being human is a guest house every morning is a new your arrival, a joy, depression and meaningless, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor, welcome and answering them all, even if you're a crowd of sorrows who violently sweep your house empty

10:00
Mary: of Its furniture. I'm definitely like finding quotes that make more sense to you. You know, like, maybe like, a less jargony quote could also, like, be more helpful. And sometimes, like, even when I read quotes like this, I'm like, What is going on. And so kind of like having different passages that allow us to be more aware, right? And so allow us to, kind of like, appreciate ourselves and appreciate our bodies a little bit more for all the wonderful things that they do to keep us alive.

10:34
Tony: And feel free to share source material that not simply from, like, you know, a poet or a writer. It could be scripture from the Bible, or even an inspirational figure from the community who said things that have really kind of resonated with some of the things of this program. So really open to any and all kinds of people that we should kind of source and bring into this manual.

11:07
Mary: I know, like another source could be, I know some people had definitely mentioned, like, maybe including, like, serenity prayer, for example, is another, like scriptural reference that we could definitely add for those people who are Christian and practice like the Christian religion. I know I see it all the time as a way to kind of calm myself down. So that could also be another element that we could definitely like include in the manual as well when we think about passages and quotes.
Vicki:  Yeah, I like the Serenity Prayer. I

11:49
Mary: awesome, anything else.

11:57
Mary: So for the next, for the next, like, 10 ish minutes, I'm just gonna, like, try to, like briefly, give you another review of the other sessions that we just kind of like fly through them a little bit quickly.
Tony: Could I interrupt you for a second? There's just, like, two little things I was thinking about before we go into the other sessions.

12:18
Tony: So I apologize if we had already talked about this. But one thing that's kind of come up previously is actually the duration of each session.

12:27
Tony: Interestingly, when we made this program, we shortened the duration from two to one hour because we felt like people might be very busy and they might not have time to commit to a full two hours once a week or eight weeks. However, we've also gotten feedback that one hour itself, while it might be enough to like, learn the content, it's not enough to emphasize, you know, this aspect of community and gathering people together and making connections and helping each other out.

12:59
Tony: So there was also the suggestion, almost like, go back to two hours, but to bake in more time, to just let people be and talk outside of, you know, the typical course material. So I'm curious what folks think about this session lasting, like one hour versus two hours once a week,

13:19
Tony: and what that might mean in terms of, like, engagement,

13:25
Miguel: 2 hours always don't sound that bad,

13:27
Tony: okay, yeah,

13:31
Miguel: I'm just a little confused today, because I got in too late, you know,
Tony: no you're good. I understand these things

13:39
Tony: other people's thoughts about time, you know, again, one versus two hours.

13:46
Leah: Well, two hours is is better, because this is eight weeks. If we did it probably for less hours, then we probably would have to do it longer,

13:56
Tony: okay?

13:58
Tony: And, um, you know, again, some of the driver for this is the idea that, you know, we want to kind of create a space for people, not only to learn impactful of skills, but also to kind of share out, maybe things that they are going through in the week, and especially in relation to pain or just kind of connecting with folks in the group, so that, again, people are talking and chatting and making community happen.
Miguel: Well, from my behalf, I'm always in pain, like I wake up with pain. I go to sleep with pain, and it's usually my back, my lower back, it's always hurting. And sometimes when I stand up too long,

14:35
Miguel: my my old back start hurting. The bottom of my feet start pounding, and I would have to sit down. So I would sit down for so long as well, because my lower back start aching again. So then I find myself laying down and I feel a whole lot better.

14:54
Tony: That’s an interesting thing, and I probably could circle back to that, because there's both good and bad things about

15:00
Tony: At rest, but I'm glad that there's a system that works for you, at least for the moment.

15:06
Tony: Okay, so it sounds like we got a good consensus about time, and it's like maybe two hours is actually okay.

15:13
Tony: Make it an enjoyable two hours, rather than just like a full on kind of like teaching experience. Leah: Yes, make it fun.
Tony: Yeah, we're trying. We're trying. We really do want to make sure this is fun, because I think that's part of what makes something

15:31
Miguel: it also heals pain when you have fun sometimes
Leah: yes it does, and it takes the mind off of it.
Miguel: Exactly yes, yes.
Dorothy: Tony, could you email us the address instead of texting us the website.
Tony: Oh, yeah, so that'll be in the future. We're still in the process of even making the website, but once we do put it off the ground, we'll certainly send it to you. Okay,
Leah: I'm hoping that you could maybe switch up do like one in Roxbury and then maybe one in Dorchester or Mattapan.
Tony: Oh, that's interesting. I think if we were to do it in that fashion, we may switch it up in terms of, like, different times that we piloted. So, like, we could do one eight week course, like in Roxbury, and then we do another kind of test pilot in Dorchester and Mattapan and so forth. Might be tricky kind of doing it within the eight weeks, but I I definitely am taking
Leah: I know you can do it, Toy, you are the man. I know you can do it well.
Tony: I will bring it up with a team, and we'll figure out a solution that either is that or work somewhere in the middle.
Leah: Yeah, that's all I'm asking. You know I'm saying,

16:40
Tony: yeah, yeah. And then my next question is, you know, something I've been thinking about mostly because, you know, I'm not over 50, and I'm just curious, like, what, what is a respectable way to refer to somebody who is over 50, you know, like, I know, in the language of this research, we've been just using older and then, you know, some people find, like, senior is a respectable term. And I just, I know I'm coming from like, an Asian background where we have, like, specific words for your age, and so it's kind of an interesting thing for me to think about in English. But yeah, I'm curious when you think about, you know, your community, and how you think about people who, who might identify say, like, over, over 50,
Leah: I’m an OG,

17:28
Tony: yeah. What, what the Asian community uses, yeah. Also, I'll tell you, we have these terms that they call honorifics, and it's a very specific way of talking, depending on your age. When you talk to someone, you have to guess their age, like, specifically, if their grandma age auntie, age sister, age, younger sister age. And then you have to also be like, kind of, it's kind of like a game too, because you don't say like, like, if someone's an auntie, but they don't want to be called an auntie, you got to call them a sister. It's kind of funny.
Miguel: Oh, there's a lot, there's a lot of people that, uh, don't want to say their age anyways
Tony: exactly, but if we're referring to someone and say over 50, would it be, like, disrespectful if we just say like, as like an older black individual, or like a black senior? I'm just curious.
Miguel: You know, well, some people, I would think some people would get offended, yeah, yeah, yeah, Leah: mature
Miguel: especially, especially, you know, especially in women, they don't want people to know their age, yeah.

18:34
Tony: Well, that's good to know.

18:36
Tony: We'll try to be as mindful about it as possible. It's interesting, because a lot of these programs that we're developing are for specific groups of people, and sometimes that is about what kind of age bracket you're in, because that also dictates, or determines the kinds of exercises that we can do together. And I know that we're kind of running low on time. So Mary, you know, I wanted to just give you permission to, you know, not do the whole slide deck. In fact, I feel like we kind of covered the majority of everything we needed to talk about. So Mary, if, if you're comfortable, you could even just kind of zoom through the rest of the slides and just kind of give everyone else, like an overview of all the you'd like, the name of each session, as well as that kind of like intro blurb about what it is.

19:25
Mary: Yeah, I can definitely do that quickly. Sorry, nice. I definitely appreciate all our beautiful conversations we've had. So then going on to session two. This is the awareness of the body and learning about automatic pilot understanding.

19:43
Mary: Understanding automatic reactions and learning how to be more present in the moment by practicing mindfulness in daily activities. Again, definitely like the session will give you more details and different examples of that then going.

20:00
Mary: On session three, gathering the scattered mind, which is learning how to anchor ourselves in the present, using mindfulness to shift from doing to being mode.

20:11
Mary: And then Session Four, recognizing thinking, recognizing thinking, noticing getting caught in negative thoughts, using mindfulness skills to stay present and cope with stress. Again, all these sessions kind of build on each other, so you were asking you to, like, utilize those skills that you've learned in previous sessions as well.

20:34
Mary: Thank you so much, Timothy for being here. We appreciate your presence and then,

20:41
Mary: and then here again, like, like learning the three step breathing method, which will be definitely be in the session itself. Like becoming aware gathering your thoughts, and then, like expanding on those as well being being more aware over your environment and your breath and all those things. And then Session Five, thoughts are not facts. Are recognizing that negative thoughts are not truth, and giving space to respond to stress in a better way.

21:09
Mary: So there's definitely that. And then going on to Session Six, allowing and letting, letting be, allowing our feelings to be as they are, using techniques to stay mindful and grounded in difficult experiences. And again, there will be more text within each session, allowing you to really like understand these concepts on a deeper level as you go. And then session seven, taking care of yourself, noticing early signs of stress and pain and learning how to take care of our well being, again, utilizing the skills that you've learned previously to really, kind of, like, apply here and taking and take care of yourself as well. And then session eight, which is maintenance,

21:54
sorry about that. Kind of, like, bringing everything together, right? Like, it takes time, patience, persistent, to change these habits and some, sometimes it takes many years to get there, so regularly practicing mindfulness meditation and informal mindfulness daily activities with breathing space will help you use what you've learned in this program to cope better with my brain, to cope better with like not migraines, Like with chronic pain and any stresses that come about, and so just kind of like bringing everything together and allowing us to put it together so that we can better help you manage your chronic pain as well as your moods. So that's like everything on our end. So sorry that we had to fly through those very, very fast. I do know that, like Nomin also wanted to, like, say something, as well as just giving her space to do that before everybody kind of jumps off quickly.

22:51
Nomin: Thanks everyone for all of your awesome feedback. And just hearing everyone's voices, it's good to see some faces. I am just going to go do a quick thing before everyone leaves. I'm just going to share my screen.

23:06
Nomin: So I have a different study that's not a part of Tony's study. It's called healthy brains after cardiac arrest. If you or anyone you know has experienced a cardiac arrest, which is different from a heart attack, it's when the brain the heart actually stops. Please let me know. I can help refer you to a different participant study to participate in, and then I'll also add this in the text, but you will be communicating with me. It's my number, my email, so,

23:38
Nomin: yeah, I'll add this on the text for now. But if anyone knows anyone, please feel free to text me otherwise. Thanks so much, everyone.

23:51
Miguel: Thank you.
Tony: And if anyone has any last comments, feel free to chime in now. And if you want, you can also reach out later to us and tell us anything that might come to mind later, when the next time study, do

____________________________________________(end of focus group)______________________________________________________

24:09
Leah: you guys hear me, if you come across a sleep study?

24:16
Tony: I personally haven't, but perhaps I can direct you to the MGH rally website, it has a directory of all the ongoing studies, and can send you that link, maybe over text, and you can kind of search for like, usually people might search like sleep or insomnia

24:33
like a way to find studies that are ongoing around that topic. If you could put that information of how to get to all the study that would be very great. Dr Pham, let me put it in the chat right now, actually, and then if you don't,

24:50
and if it was, it like I was saying, instead of the text, send us an email. Yeah, I can email too. I have a hard time getting to link.

25:00
Off on my phone, yeah, if you drop your, if your email in the chat, I'll, I'll be sure to send it to you. I think yours is like Sister dot, 2015 or something.

25:12
Oh, 2019

25:14
Yeah, yeah, okay, at Gmail, right, yeah.

25:18
Gotcha. Okay. I'll send that to you over email and then, yep, just wanted to emphasize again, nomen study for folks with cardiac arrest. Or if you know anyone too who might be interested, I know that she would be happy to reach out to them and give them more information about this study.

25:41
Anyone else with any questions or final thoughts?

25:46
All right, all I want for myself is

25:50
to not deal with pain anymore.

25:53
Yeah, I think that I've been in pain over 30 years. I would say,

26:02
I think, yes, I think

26:05
it's tough. It's tough being in pain. I mean, I tried, well, my doctors tried a lot of pain medication that don't even help me out.

26:17
Yeah, I can definitely feel free there. And I think that a lot of folks here in this chat, as well as previous ones, have really struggled to find an answer that really addresses them as a whole person.

26:31
And I do think that at the end of the day, most people, probably in terms of these medications, don't find complete relief. But if we can try to expand our access to like different types of programs, you know, not just medications, but also these types of therapies with like mindfulness and meditation. I do think that can take off some of the edge. So happy to get your feedback too, as we kind of continue developing this program. But

26:59
thank you again for your feedback.

27:02
Tony, can you send me the stuff to email too? Okay, yeah. What's your email again?

27:09
You got a V Brantley 58 at Yahoo? Okay, got it

27:17
also include nominee

27:21
study here. Yeah, I need to get with her too, because I've been in cardiac arrest also. Okay, gotcha,

27:31
I'll actually

27:35
copy and paste the chat, but I'll definitely, I'll

27:38
definitely include it as part of the email, and include Novin as part of that email. Okay, I appreciate it. All right, thank you, Mars.

27:49
You might as well just send us all the email. Tony, okay, yeah, I didn't check your email in our database, but just in case, who would you put it in there? Oh, you put it in there, yeah? Well, to make it easier, yeah, I can make sure I got the right one. Sometimes I we have the email, but it might be wrong, and I just want to make sure

28:14
it gets to you.

28:24
Thank you.

28:27
Thank you.

28:36
All right, well, this meeting is officially adjourned. Thank you so much for your help with everything. Um, we'll be in touch with you all about the E check reimbursements. It's going to be just like before, and we'll stay in touch with you the whole way through, because we know that

28:52
it's, you know, sometimes it takes a minute and that's not super transparent at times. Sorry about the late entrance. That's okay. So what are you saying? We're gonna get reimbursed for this. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Now, are we gonna be famous? You know, because we help with this too,

29:14
I can hear you,

29:16
actually, we gotta be famous too. Oh, you know, honestly, that's something I was going to get back and we do want to give everyone credit for being able to, you know, offer their opinions and their voice on this. So basically, what I'm thinking we'll do is we'll just get the permission of anyone who's okay with having their name shared as part of, like, this development process, and we can publicize it on the website or on the manual. So yeah, we'll get back to you about that, because I do think that this, again, is like a community process, and we'd like everyone to get credit for it, not just like, you know

29:52
us, who are kind of like in the backseat, making everything kind of come together via the manual.

29:58
Oh, okay, do.

30:00
Yeah,

30:03
thanks so much, everyone. It was awesome.

30:07
You all have a great

30:11
bye, bye,

30:13
Tony. Everyone stay Okay. Take care, everyone and weekend as well. And Happy Halloween. Happy Happy Halloween.

30:28
Can we can we go now? Yep, yep, we're all done. Everyone can add up and reach out to us if you have any questions. But we'll also be reaching out to y'all individually about reimbursements and so forth. Okay, how would I get out of this thing? Oh, yes, usually it's in the bottom right. You see something bottom right, people have like, an End button or a Get Out button. Okay, I think you got it all right. I think that's just us, right?

30:57
Good job. Mary, that was really good. I appreciate you taking the spotlight off of us. I think we covered everything.

31:07
Yeah, it's interesting. I don't know if anyone has any, like, reflections or thoughts they want to figure it out. We don't have to, like, stay here too long, but I don't want it on our mind.

31:17
I do have a quick question from the other focus groups. We'll be able to at least get some sort of feedback from the other sessions, I know, like we didn't get to them today, so just wasn't sure if you were able to. I mean, we got some feedback. But even when I did go through it, I felt like there's two factors going on. People's brains were a little fried, and then the second is, just like,

31:40
I felt like the feedback was almost like meta feedback, still kind of in a sense of like generally, how we need to phrase

31:49
certain like concepts and how we deliver the materials. I do think that the intro itself kind of sets the stage for how we frame the subsequent sessions, you know, in terms of, like, people's reaction to the graphics, people's reaction to the terms and the audio recordings, the video format and so forth.

32:13
So there's also the part of me that's, in a way, almost like less worried about the other sessions, because I think that the content themselves is is pretty straightforward,

32:23
and I'm glad that we did get general feedback about, like, what it means to have home practice in session. So, yeah, we didn't really, but I'm curious, no man, what you think, whether that might be something that will bite us in the butt later or whatever.

32:39
I don't think so really, I think it was less about, like specific content material, but more so about how best to deliver it, and what sorts of like formatting people enjoy the most and like how to increase engagement, which I think were, like the key things that we wanted more information on, just because, like, I feel like, once we have those down, We can kind of introduce, like the main topics in a way that fits best with everyone

33:06
nice.

33:10
I also feel like a lot of the as I don't know if I mean, I said this, but a lot of the feedback that we got again can, like be applied across the board as well. So just kind of like finding different ways to, like a lot of the events that we got, like, how can we apply Session 234,

33:27
to just optimize it for everyone?

33:30
So there's definitely like that, yeah, aspect of things, I'm feeling more optimistic about our ability to get this done. Only struggle is generally trying to get it done sooner, but definitely a lot on

33:45
for me to kind of go through, which is, I think, a long time coming, but I can hopefully try to set aside some more time this weekend, if I finish this grant

33:54
writing on time. It was interesting. There's two things I was thinking about. One of one was

34:02
Mr. Bagel kind of came in late, so I was kind of like trying to process live. I don't handle reimbursement in that way. On the one hand, it's like, damn, there was only two guys across the three days, so kind of would be clutch to have him. He did also definitely kind of say stuff, even though some folks were there the whole time and probably didn't say much.

34:26
So there's a part of me that just kind of wants to keep it simple and just kind of give them the full amount. But the other part is like, I don't want to, I only break this up because it's interesting. Like, in prior focus groups, people have kind of raised like, oh, like, this person didn't contribute, and they should, like, be compensated less or something, actually, just say it on the nose, like Miss Terry was like, oh, this person was there the whole time, and they didn't say anything. And I was like, Yeah, I know. But, you know, some people are more shy,

34:55
but they know coming in late, though, that's kind of like a different thing. And so there's a part of me that.

35:00
Like, Oh, should we just kind of compensate him based on, like, it's time that he, he came in, you know, which was like, I guess, like a quarter of the two hours, eg, like a quarter of 250

35:13
should just give him the 250

35:15
and just kind of rolled it? I think we could do a quarter honestly. I feel like he wouldn't mind to be honest. Yeah, you seem terrible. That's that's just me, kind of like getting vibes from his personality, like he understands that he was late. So then, like, if you questioned why didn't give it to 50, we could literally just be honest and be like, you just came in a little bit late. So then, like, you get

35:39
the amount of money with which the equivalent to the time that you see. So we could just be honest that way, yeah, we could. We could just say, like, hey, you know, part of, like, our MGH policy is when we have folks in the focus, which we generally reimburse them based on, like, the, you know, the proportion of the meeting that they were able to attend. And that may make, just make it less like personal or something,

36:04
definitely, yeah, I always love a good MGH policy, yeah, my go to Line

36:11
some shadowy figures dictating this.

36:14
Okay, I don't know if no man or Denise, you had any hot takes on that. If not, no, I agree. I think

36:22
having like, I wouldn't want people to like, think that it's not to say it's okay, but like, have that be like, a pattern that's like, repeated throughout, yeah, okay. And then I gotta be honest with y'all, I'm just like, for some reason, just really focus on just getting a name that works, and it's just feel like it's been kind of like all over the place before, with respect to what people like like this session, it was like hoping and coping, and then the feeling of healing,

36:53
I think before that's been kind of like the main top two though, yeah, it's true feeling of being one last time, right?

37:02
And then before that, it was literally both Cynthia's bringing up those two names. So Cynthia Jones brought up the

37:10
mindfulness, head to toe pain go. And then the other Cynthia brought up both feeling of healing and hoping and coping.

37:20
I personally was thinking, like, the pain go. One was a bit, like, too long, like, I thought, like, it was, there's too many, like, random things going on. It was like, mindfulness, head to toe, and then randomly, it was like, pain go. But it's cool that it Ryan, but I don't know if y'all had any opinions too about the name.

37:38
Actually, I think, oh, sorry, that's all I had to say.

37:46
I think I like the living through pain. I feel like it's the most like exact wording on what the manual is. It's like allowing people to live through pain. Yeah, so I think that one was really nice. Sorry to interrupt.

38:05
Yeah, I was gonna say living through pain or hoping and coping, because I feel like both of those really touch upon the fact that like, you're not necessarily treating the pain. You're just helping people like manage and like continue to do live their lives essentially despite it. Yeah, I agree, too. Living through pain is the most straightforward in terms of, like, the overall goal of this program. And yet, I can't help but realize that there's kind of, like, a disparity between this group and the one before, like yesterday, people were like, vehemently, like to actually, they were against living with pain and living through pain, because it felt like it diminished the fact that they've already been doing that. And

38:48
then this group was like, there's some people like, Oh, those are good. So I just was, I, yeah, it's interesting. So I'm glad that y'all are saying saying this too

39:01
cool. Any other thoughts before we

39:04
disconnect?

39:07
Um, I just have a question. Are you planning on doing more focus groups? Um, versus the last like set of focus groups? This is the last set for the depression and chronic pain study. However, we do still have funding for, like, more for, like, the memory related problems and chronic pain, which is like the paper said that you're working on. And so we can't expect to do that. It'll be interesting, because it'll probably be with a lot of the same people, and they'll probably be thinking about the same stuff and saying the same things, which is okay, I guess maybe

39:47
we'll see how we decide to do it the next time. But yeah, definitely

39:53
planning to do some focus groups again for the memory related problem study. Okay?

40:01
Other last minute thoughts, questions.

40:07
Cool. All right. Well, thanks again for just keeping me sane this week, and I'll keep you updated. Try to send another update email, which is kind of like task and overview what we need to get done.

40:22
Great job. Everyone, yeah, thanks. Everyone,

40:26
bye, bye. Have a good Halloween. Be safe. Peace. You.

Tony Pham  00:00
All right, y'all thank you for coming today. I'll do a quick overview about today, and kind of hand it off to Nomin after this, so we can talk about parts of the program that we're building together. So this is, as you know, this is the Mass General Mind Body program for chronic pain and mood. We are in the process of still making our manual based off of people's feedback, but we've been working hard, and we just thought we'd convene people again to get some feedback. One thing I should kind of warn y'all about is this focus group is going to be a bit more dry, because it's more about us like showing y'all stuff, and then y'all telling us, "oh, like, that's good, that's bad, I don't like this", and just a reminder about our program and some points of potential confusion. So this is one of two studies that we're working on, and they're kind of similar. They're both culturally adapting a program called mindfulness based cognitive therapy for chronic pain, but this one that we're going to talk about today is for chronic pain and depression or mood, and then the other one is for chronic pain and memory concerns. And it's interesting that we're doing it this way, and it's just because I think chronic pain is a big topic, and sometimes it's good to have programs that focus on one kind of issue in relation to chronic pain, and this one is about mood. And as you all know, we're gearing up to do a pilot. And you know, part of this pilot is that we're trying to make sure that this is a program that works for all different types of people, different people of different backgrounds, different genders, and in particular, we're working on seeing whether people who would identify as like a black senior would find this program helpful for their chronic pain or mood. Okay. So this is us. This is me, Nomin, Mary. And I don't think y'all met Denise, but she's recently joined our team, and she's been working hard on kind of helping us with project development and getting the manual out and getting this pilot done, hopefully. This is Mr. Kincade. I don't think I really need to introduce him, but you know, he's been really shepherding this project with us, and I'm just very thankful for him, so I thought I'd do a quick shout out. And yeah, everyone here, you know, I think I consider you all as part of this team of people who are helping us really make this manual happen, and helping this pilot get off the ground, because at the end of the day, we're just trying to make a Mind Body program that works for the community, that's sustainable, that's, you know, not costing a lot of money or hopefully just free. And I think we are seeing a lot of already cool programs out there, and hopefully this is just one of many, yes, next slide. Okay, so before I get into this, I just thought we'd give some space to say hi to each other. I know a lot of folks here already know everyone, but just in case, we need a refresher, why don't we just go around? I'm going to call people out if that's okay, and just share your name, where you're calling in from, and how your day is going. So I'll start my name is Tony, as you all know, I'm calling in from Somerville, and my day is going okay. This week has been a bit busy, just trying to get everything through. But I'm just trying to stay positive, and luckily, I got some good company right now. Miss Jeannie?

Genie  04:44
Hi, how you doing, I'm doing well. I'm from Roxbury, and so far my day, my day is coming along fairly well.

Tony Pham  04:56
Excellent. I think we have an iPhone 214, or maybe that's Miss Janelle.

Janelle  05:01
Yes, that's me. I I'll change that. I don't know why it's up there.

Tony Pham  05:06
It's funny, I recognize your number.

Janelle  05:09
Well, thank you. My name is Janelle, and I'm from Dorchester, and my day is going really, really good. The only thing is, my week has been crazy because I've been working the polls. So yeah, but yeah, you're welcome. Overall, it's been really, really good, and I'm having a great day.

Genie  05:32
I'm sorry, Dr. Tony, I wanted to say the same thing. It's been a crazy week as well, winding down from the winding down from the breast cancer events and also from the pose as well.

Tony Pham  05:45
Sorry to hear that, but I'm hoping things are kind of leveling out this week too, as it goes on.

Genie  05:52
I know me too

Tony Pham  05:56
Well, if we have some time, I'd love to kind of process stuff together too, as a group, but I think we should have some time later today too, or later in this session, because that is some big stuff you just mentioned. Um, Miss Donna?

Donna  06:09
Okay, oh, hi, Tony. I'm calling in from, I'm Donna Walker calling in from Dorchester. My day is going pretty good. Um, I've had a couple of meetings this morning and a couple appointments, and my week is going to be crazy. The rest of the week is going to be crazy, but so far so good.

Tony Pham  06:37
I'm hearing a trend here. Um, yeah, hi, Miss Soraya, I see you're clicking around.

Soraya  06:53
Hello everyone. Good afternoon. I'm Soraya, my day started off busy, still busy. I went to Roxbury Community College to take two college courses, I mean, test exams. Now I'm doing some other things. I'm waiting for my grandson so I can take him to the Boys and Girls Club, but to get out of school early, but busy week, like Donna said, the rest of the week, never done.

Tony Pham  07:28
Miss Talya?

Talya  07:32
hello everybody. How you doing. My day started off a little on the smooth side, and then things got a little crazy, and it's been it's, um, I don't know how to describe it at this point. I just -  about 30 minutes or so ago, got a call from my manager. He's been following me all day, "are you working?" I'm like, "Yes, I'm doing work". I'm like, don't even know what to do. I am working from the house today. But he's like, "Stop doing that". I had no clue that I was supposed to been working on something else, and I just found out, and I have 232 cases to process now. So I don't know if its supposed to be done today, because this is a lot of work, and I'm like, really? And I am the only one doing it, so that's how my day is going right now.

Tony Pham  08:50
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry to hear that. And I feel like sometimes there's a lot of top down communication, especially when they don't really understand the full nature of their expectations. But I appreciate you telling us about that and helping us understand where you're coming from today. And Miss Teri?

Teri  09:14
Good afternoon. I'm from Dorchester, but I'm zooming in from South Boston right now, I'm at work, so I'm kind of multitasking. We've been, you know, having some early mornings been here since five something. So yeah, I'm keeping it short and sweet. You can get this ball rolling right on.

Tony Pham  09:35
And lastly, Nomin?

Nomin  09:38
Hi everyone. My name is Nomin. I've spoken to a few of you guys before on the phone. It's nice to see everyone's faces. I'm a research coordinator on the study. I am zooming in from the office, but I live in Allston, and my day is also pretty busy, busy week, but excited to be here and speak with everyone today.

Tony Pham  10:03
All right, well, again, thank you everyone for catching us up to speed and saying hi. I'm going to pass the baton over to Nomin now, but I'm going to be here just hanging out, kind of taking notes. And again, what we're going to do is we're going to just walk you all through this manual. Obviously, I wish we could talk about everything, but we're just going to highlight some specific things that we feel like your feedback will be most helpful with. So yeah, Nomin, take it away.

Nomin  10:32
All right. So what I will do is just give a brief overview of the summary of the program, and I'll mostly be emphasizing the introduction as well as the session one, since that'll be most of the meat for our program, and we'll also be listening to some audio recordings, looking at some handouts and other stuff, just to hear everyone's feedback on everything. I wanted to mention, please feel free to interrupt me and give me any sort of feedback whenever you guys want to, and I hope to hear from at least everyone today. But yes, and also feel free to drop stuff in the chat as well. So to give sort of a outline, our program will be eight weeks long, we will meet once a week for one hour. This is a Mind Body program, so it means we'd be talking about things like mindfulness, meditation, exercise and how that relates to chronic pain. So this, we're hoping to change what is already an established type of therapy called mindfulness based cognitive therapy, and adapt it for older, Black adults. So on the screen here we have the overview of the manual, so we have introduction and then all the session names, I won't go too much in detail about each one of them, but the first session will be more about orientation and introduction. So like making sure everyone is oriented with the program, but also just making sure that we as a community and as a group get to know each other and feel more safe within the group. So this is sessions five to eight, and then at the end we might have like a conclusion or something like that's similar. Okay, so I won't read through all of the things within the introductions, but this is sort of - I'll go through step by step about what we have, and feel free to interrupt me at any time, but I'll also be asking some specific questions. So we start off with kind of giving, like the goal of this program, and you'll see here, it says the quiet focus program, but we're also brainstorming on some name ideas. So we'd love to hear your guys' opinions on some good names or anything like that. So here we talk about how people deal with chronic pain, how it causes stress and unhappiness and not really being able to engage with life the way that we want to. We also mentioned about how we can't completely avoid stress or difficult things in life, and we need to learn how to kind of work with ourselves to reconnect with life. And the goal of the program is to help people with chronic pain improve their mood, physical, functioning and overall well being. So we've heard we also did a focus group similar to this yesterday, and we've heard from folks that this might be a little bit too much writing, so we're hoping to make this into a video format, meaning everything here that's written one of us, either me, Tony or Mary, will film ourselves and just kind of give the introduction as a video so that people can understand it easier. We are hoping to make this hybrid so in person and virtual for people who are maybe unable to make it in person and each session will last an hour. There was also some conversation yesterday about maybe making it more or less, so feel free to let me know what you guys think. And so with the quiet focus, since it is a research study for the first iteration of the program, will be doing what's called, like a feasibility or acceptance, which means we're going to see how well it works, and then, hopefully, spread it across different ethnicities, races, incomes, but for now, we'll just be working with older Black individuals so that it's tailored and adapted for y'all. Okay, so this part talks about how to get the most out of the program. So this part kind of emphasizes regular attendance. We have some home practice exercises, which we'd love to get more of your feedback as well, but completing worksheets and just really making sure to be persistent and patient with yourself and with us while we find the best ways to make sure that everyone gets the most out of this. There's also a section here talking about how we may not be able to benefit immediately, but people who attend more sessions and engage consistently get the most out of it. So I'll pause for now and just hear if anyone has anything to say about any of what has been mentioned so far.

Soraya  16:14
How do we sign up?

Nomin  16:18
So yeah, yeah, go for it. Just right now, we're doing the focus groups for the first program, but Tony, I'm not sure when is the open pilot starting again?

Tony Pham  16:31
Yeah, so we know we're trying to get this pilot off as soon as we can. We're thinking like, if we can finish this manual by like, mid November, maybe even, like, early December or late December. I know that's kind of tricky with the holidays, but, you know, that's kind of like the timeline for hopefully, when we can get this off and running. However. I think there's some other kind of technicalities around how this is a research project and kind of involving people into it. I think there's kind of like a tier in terms of, like, who would most be appropriate for, like a pilot that is like the first version of us delivering this program. And typically, we always in research, try to get different people for different parts of the study, and this would be like, a different part. However, I do think that I'm just gonna kind of pass along the idea to some of our research collaborators about, oh, what if we got the people from our, you know, community advisory board who have done, like the focus groups with us to do the pilot. And I think that's actually, I think that could be done. There's another thing I should add in there too, which is this pilot is only going to be with eight people. And so, you know, there's, I think, a little bit over 20 of us as part of, like these focus groups that we've been running. And so if we do draw from y'all, I will say, probably we'll have to do some kind of, like, transparent lottery system, just because, you know, I know that I would love for everyone to take part, but unfortunately for the funding we got, we were only able to fund a pilot with eight people. That said there's going to be further iterations of it too. And we're also, like, we're saying, doing another program that's similar to this, but instead of chronic pain and depression, it's chronic pain and memory issues. So you know, that's also a possibility. And then not completely sure about the later iterations because of some other kind of research rules, but I'll definitely keep you updated. I guess I just wanted to give that general overview without raising expectations too high, given that it's almost like the further we go into this project, the less spots there are to like take part and help us pilot it, mostly doing this focus group now, because I think it's just nice to get more feedback from y'all, especially after all the great work we've been doing in the previous focus groups

Teri  19:09
Because I was going to say, Well, she didn't, she say there was going to be different ones. So like, if only eight. So like, you pick eight for the first one, and then she said there was chronic pain and something else, and then another eight. Do that one, right? Yeah, that way everybody can participate in at least one study.

Tony Pham  19:26
And we're also a part of, like, a larger research group. And there's other projects that are quite similar, honestly, also working with chronic pain, and I've been very happy to, like, honestly, share the fact that I know that there's, there's more interest than sometimes they even know about and so helping them know that, like y'all, are interested in these kind of projects. Because I think that I'm not thinking this program is, you know, the end all be all. I think it's just one of many great things out there. And I would certainly be happy to kind of continue helping y'all get in touch with as many like pilots and programs like this as possible, because it definitely boosts our morale. I just wish we had more, more going at the same time,

Donna  20:10
I have a question like, males also eligible to participate, because I always usually see females.

Tony Pham  20:18
Yes, I think that's actually something that's interesting. We actually would prefer more males, but for, I guess, reasons related to just, I don't know, maybe, like, just how it's been working out, the culture of kind of participation and stuff, you know, you less often see guys in the mix, but we want to see more. And I think we've seen some communications and conversations going on at UCB, you know, like kind of making space for for guys to kind of get together and talk and that could be a conversation all in its own. But to answer your question, we would definitely be interested in guys because, you know, this pilot that we're planning is seeing whether this program would fit well with the values and requests of people who would identify as like a black senior, and that includes both men and women. So I'm glad you mentioned that, and we would be happy to receive any information for especially any men who might be interested in participating. And then I think Miss Talya has been patiently raising her hand.

Talya  21:26
Am I on the right one? Isn't this the one where we're supposed to be talking about the study that we was already a part of, am I in the right link?

Tony Pham  21:26
I hope so. Um, you've already, volunteered, actually, I think you did a focus group before, right about the chronic pain and then the the depression, Yes, yep. So this is a follow up to that. And so basically

Talya  22:02
Oh okay, I thought this was something totally different.

Tony Pham  22:05
So no, no, you're good. So I'll, I'll kind of help orient everyone again. So basically this whole time, we've been getting feedback from y'all via these focus groups on how to make this program happen. And the first time we had met during that focus group, we just got, like, a general overview of, like, what are people's thoughts on chronic pain? What about like, feeling down about your chronic pain, and what about getting care for your chronic pain, or even the program itself? But as we've been taking y'all feedback and putting it in to like, developing this program, I think we've ourselves wanted to kind of reconnect with y'all and kind of share some materials that we've been working on, just so we can get more feedback now that we have more concrete stuff like to show you. So hopefully, yeah, everything kind of goes okay, and people can give us their thoughts, whether good or bad about what we have to share. Miss Janelle?

Janelle  23:05
Yes, she said something okay. First of all, I got a call the other day, I guess, about one of these focus groups, but it was all in person. And then I heard Nomin say that this eight week program, some of it's in person, and some of it's zoom. If you're not able to get in person, do you qualify or no?

Tony Pham  23:31
See, okay, so I don't know what that other call was. I imagine it may have been a different study.

Janelle  23:38
Well, it was from somebody from your office, because they use your name.

Tony Pham  23:43
Oh think it was probably, it may have been Mary.

Donna  23:45
I think it was Mary because Mary called me too, and it was, yeah, pain management and memory. Yes, I had this morning.

Tony Pham  23:54
Um, I'll so for this program, though, we're going to do it both ways, because again, from the previous conversations we've had, you know, sometimes there are days where it's hard to get in, but also people are saying that it's nice to have that in person element. So we're trying to meet in the middle and say, like, okay, you know, this is an in person program, but if you can't make it on certain days, just feel free to join in by zoom, and it'll be kind of like a hybrid format. But, you know, I wouldn't worry too much about that, because I feel like this is also an opportunity to deliver your input to if you see something as part of the program now, because we we're still changing it and we're still making it so, you know, if there's something you see that you'd like to, you know, change, tell us right now, and we would be happy to incorporate it. And I think that, luckily, we have heard before that having a hybrid format would be easiest for folks, especially because just hearing from y'all talk about your day today, you know, like, seems like some days y'all are really juggling a lot from classes to medical issues, so I'm glad you bring that up.

Donna  25:07
Thank you.

Tony Pham  25:10
Any anyone else with some questions or burning thoughts? I think I see Miss Soraya?

Soraya  25:20
Yes, what particular days would that be on? And I didn't hear from that person, but I heard someone else heard from that person as well about the pain.

Tony Pham  25:31
yeah. I'll talk with Mary. I mean, yeah, I'm sorry about that. I think that she's kind of working real hard, and I think she's going through the folks who you know I've kind of brought into studies that I particularly work on, and I think she's probably behind in contacting everyone, but I'll make sure to get on I'll make sure to remind her to reach out to everyone on the list. I do think that they also have limited availability. But I think it is like you're saying fair for her to contact everyone that I've given her the names of. So she should be able to I think she's just really overworked right now. So if we just give her maybe, like, a few days, she should be able to get to you.

Janelle  26:16
But Tony, I do want to say that she said that's only in person that particular Yeah, you gotta show up once a week.

Tony Pham  26:23
Separate program.

Donna  26:27
Yeah, yeah. 12 week program, yep.

Tony Pham  26:31
And I had my hand in that program too, a bit, and I think it's a real cool one. So I'm looking forward to anyone who can take part in that too, um, but I appreciate you bringing that up. I'll send Mary a message after this. Um, other thoughts, alright. Well, we distracted from Nomin enough. I'm going to send it back to her.

Nomin  26:55
Thank you.

Genie  26:55
Oh, my hand is raised.

Tony Pham  26:57
Oh, your hands raised. I'm sorry, yeah. Oh, I didn't see my screen's kind of weird.

Genie  27:05
Oh, that's okay. I just wanted to know about the program. Is it a paid program? If it is, how does that work? What happens, you know, and I need you know more detail about that and being in person or on Zoom like, you know, Miss Janelle said, you know, how does it work if you're eligible or not? Um,

Tony Pham  27:30
are you talking about, sorry, were you talking about the the call from Mary or this program right now that we're talking about,

Genie  27:38
I didn't, I didn't get a call from anyone but you.

Tony Pham  27:41
Oh, okay, so this program coming up, it is a paid program. It's basically us being able to deliver this program that we're currently putting into play. I'm still working out the numbers as far as the compensation, so I can't say for sure yet, but I can certainly as we're finishing up the development of it, and as soon as we do find out, and if we can turn to y'all to enroll y'all into the first pilot, I can definitely tell you about the the numbers and such.

Genie  28:16
Okay, then, all right.

Tony Pham  28:20
Thank you. Back to you Nomin

Nomin  28:27
All right, so I think Ms Saraya asked something about what day of the week it was going to be on, and that's something we're actually asking folks like, what days are usually freer for everyone, what days make the most amount of sense, and talking about logistics, each one will last approximately an hour, and this is also subject to change. So if you guys want any kind of change, like there's no, we won't take any offense to anything, and it's in hybrid, so in person and virtual, as Tony stated, with eight other people, and we have an instructor that will be trained by Doctor Tony. Um. So does anyone have any thoughts on like, what days of the week would work best?

Janelle  29:18
Well, this is Janelle. I will be doing in the zoom. So any day is really good for me, okay. And I don't have a preference,

Soraya  29:33
Yeah, mine just Monday or Thursday. That's Soraya.

Genie  29:43
Yeah, it's just Genie. I pretty much, I'm flexible pretty much during the week, but I actually I like the mornings because I have, like, full schedules in the afternoon, so mornings will work best with me. Days. I have to, like, kind of pick and choose, because I have a lot going on as well, a lot of appointments with doctors and taking tests and depression and pain and all that stuff. So I would have to, you know, go with flow, with you all, and see what, what you all have coming up that I may but I definitely want to participate in this program and and I wanted to know if in person, where would it be at, if it's in person?

Donna  30:31
That's what I was going to ask.

Nomin  30:34
That's what I was also going to mention afterwards. So I'm not sure if you guys remember for one of the previous focus groups that we did. I think we did it in the Grove Hall library. We also have some ideas of the Central Boston Elderly Services in Roxbury. We're still trying to work with everyone and see where there's space. But does anyone know of any good places, or, like, any places that would be best in terms of, like transportation or anything like that.

Genie  31:07
Well, I think for me, I like the Grove Hall library. It's closer, it's convenient. It's, you know, not saying that the elder services isn't, but it's just a little bit out of the way for me, even though I'm in Roxbury, I'm close to Grove Hall, so for me, that will work best. But if you can't do the library, I can make it to central Boston, or pretty much wherever. I just have to figure it out once it's decided.

Donna  31:41
Grovel Hall library also works for me? This is Donna.

Nomin  31:44
And I think once we have a place set in mind, we're hoping to have the sessions land on a specific day of the week, so maybe every Thursday in the morning time or every Saturday, so that it's consistent throughout the eight weeks and that people can like come as they come. Okay, so moving on to guided videos and audio recordings, just because, um, we want to make this more interactive, more engaging, a little bit less, I guess you have to read everything and just follow along everything. So we're hoping to make some videos, you can see our faces, and also make some audio recordings to help with getting the skills in place. Later on, we'll listen to an audio recording, it'll be short, five minutes, and everyone can let me know what they think of it, what they like, what they don't, and we can talk from there.

Donna  32:45
That sounds great, rather than reading everything,

Talya  32:50
Yeah, because that's what I was going to say. I'm like, if we have to read it all, so that's good. If it has audio, that's awesome.

Nomin  32:56
Okay, that's good to hear. And then here we have some things about, like, some ground rules. So for example, like making sure that we want to respect everyone's privacy, since we will be talking about pain, mood, sadness, stuff like that. People might want to share their own life experiences with, and just making sure that we don't discuss other people's details outside of the program. And some other rules, like, if you can't attend a session, please let someone know, being on time, bringing your workbook, treating people with kindness, respect, listening, and there's also an emphasis on trying to commit to attending all the sessions, since consistency within this program will help you get the best out of everything. And then also, since we know we are working with people with chronic pain, so like, feel free to stand stretch or walk around as needed. And that also counts for here, if you guys need to take a stretch, please feel free to do so. But do you guys have any other rules, or sort of things that we should also mention?

Genie  34:11
I think you pretty much covered the piece about, you know, being confidential, because, you know, a lot of us will be sharing some of our personal stories I know for me, I will, because that's where a lot of my chronic pain come from my personal job so that helps, and I appreciate that.

Nomin  34:36
Okay, sounds good. Thank you. All right, I think within the introduction, I'm not sure if we're going to place all the education stuff here. Since yesterday, we heard some other feedback, but for now, we have a lot of stuff about pain, education, about chronic pain, stuff like that, within the introduction. So we have a section about why do we experience pain? And we I think Mary made this, right Tony? But here's a diagram of how musculoskeletal pain so like pain that's involved with joints, muscles, tendons, stuff like that and how our brain alert system signals to the brain through your nerves, and we'll have things like this to kind of help people understand better. So as I said, musculoskeletal pain includes things like arthritis, nerve pain and so forth. So this is the type of chronic pain that we'll be focusing on, and then some information about what we mean by chronic pain, so like pain that's lasting for more than three months, and how it's different from acute pain. So this is another infographic that Mary made about the difference between acute pain and chronic pain, and we'll can discuss this further. But here is some information, and I think having it laid out like this makes it easier to comprehend and try to, like, really visualize it. And then some other information about what shapes chronic pain. So the way you express your pain can be different depending on, for example, how you were raised, your gender, your ethnicity, your mental well being, as I think it was Miss. Genie Curry mentioned, level education, everything. There's so many things that affect chronic pain. Uh, yes, Donna, Miss Donna? Did you mean to raise your hand?

Donna  36:58
Yes, I thought I was talking, but I was still muted. Could you go back to the previous screen? I was trying to take a snap of it.

Nomin  37:07
 Yeah, of course.

Tony Pham  37:08
Y'all might recognize this later because we're - because I work with the HABIT team. We're kind of sharing some of these graphics, and some of it actually won't remain for the manual that we're currently making, because you can see here, you know, we're talking about acute burst chronic pain, and you kind of like transition and talk about how, like, oh, it's helpful to kind of maintain a lifestyle of walking, which is actually important. Interestingly, though, our program isn't focused too much on walking, even though it's important, but we just happen to have it in this graphic because we're still working on it. And that said, I do think it's interesting to know if people could give us feedback on, like, what makes a graphic work for them. You know, in terms of, like, explaining key issues like chronic pain, like depression, like mindfulness, because I know that we're all different learners and different. We have different styles of of taking in new information. So if y'all ever you know throughout this time that we're talking right now, have feedback on what makes a graphic work for you, especially in relation to learning new things. We'd be happy to incorporate that, because we're also in the process of making our graphics for this program, and we'd like to make sure that it just is very understandable. So back to you, Nomin, thank you.

Nomin  38:30
So we have some information here about race and how older black adults report higher rates of chronic pain conditions while also reporting on their pain less than white people or older white adults. There's more challenges in receiving pain management and health care and just sort of racial issues around chronic pain that we wanted to highlight just because we are only involving people who are older, Black adults. And then we also have some information about physical mobility or exercise, so too much rest can make us feel like we're falling behind on our progress. But then, like we try to make up for lost time by doing too much, which can cause even more pain. So just kind of considering finding that balance between exercise but not overextending yourself too much. And then here are some options for chronic pain treatments or dealing or treating with chronic pain. So a lot of the times chronic pain. It's a no size fits all model, and we require different forms of treatment. So we have stuff like alternative therapies, like herbal remedies, traditional healing methods, and I think y'all have talked about even like Vapor Rub. And stuff like that, physical therapy, exercise medications, behavioral treatments. Is there any other thing that you all consider to be things that help with chronic pain that we should mention here?

Janelle  40:18
I did, this is Janelle. I did a mindfulness class with Boston Medical and that really, really helps to get your mind into a different state. And I'll give you an example. I was working the pose, and I had scolding hot tea spilt on my chest. And rather than be worried, you know, get angry, I calmed myself down, I didn't scream. Only thing I kept saying to myself is, don't blister from the scaling hot water. And I didn't yell at the person, because it was an accident, so, you know, and it was hurting, but it was like I didn't feel it because where my mind was, you know, know what I'm saying?

Genie  41:10
Yeah, okay,

Nomin  41:13
That's great to hear, um, not too great to hear that you had hot water spilled on you. But I understand that is the idea that we're trying to teach here, being mindful, but also understanding that even if you do feel the pain, you can maybe redirect your attention. But yeah, maybe we can include stuff like mindfulness or meditation within this treatment. So thank you. And then we have a section here about chronic pain and emotional well being, so talking about how your emotions can influence your pain, and your pain could influence your emotions. And also, for example, talking about how chronic pain could get in the way of work or attending a family birthday, or other things like that, which can be really frustrating and feel like an extra baggage. And so throughout the manual, by sessions, by the introductions, we have passages, quotes, and in this case, case studies of different people, Linda is not a real person, I don't think. But here is an example of something that kind of creates a story out of the things that we were talking about previously. So here I'll read this out for people. Linda enjoys going for long walks with her grandkids one day, however, a car unexpectedly collides with her. She has recovered from this car accident. However, since then, she has experienced chronic pain in her shoulder. Despite multiple medical workups, doctors were not able to pinpoint why she has continued to experience chronic pain. They were, however, able to rule out life threatening causes such as cancer. Regardless, she has continued to worry about why her shoulder pain has not gone away to the point of losing sleep. She now has trouble planning on her life, and no longer goes and walks as she used to. She now notices a significant drop in her physical functioning and quality of life. Her pain also feels worse at this point, she now feels hopeless over where she will ever get better. What are people's thoughts on this case study? Do you think including things like this is helpful? Does it help make sense of other things that we talked about? Or do you guys have any recommendations?

Soraya  43:42
I think yes, because everybody's different. So giving them different options of different things they can use for, you know, mindfulness, or for their pain, or to take that, you know, or the thought or the pain away, or whatever, because I know exactly what the lady was speaking of, because I was part of that study with the healthy brain. And they teach you, like, different meditations for like certain things to kind of like, you know, clear your mind and how to, like, bring your mind back, um, when it like wanders or whatever, or to get to sleep. So you're not thinking about 50 million things when you can't go to sleep. So like, just giving people different options is always good. You know would be, you know, for meditation, whether it be physical, whether it be you know, whatever. So going over or giving people different options or choices is always good. So it's not just one blueprint to fit everybody definitely and plus, people have different problems. Well, so causing your pain or whatever, so you have to give people different options.

Nomin  45:07
Okay, that makes a lot of sense. I think it could be also interesting to have these case studies, maybe within the sessions, and then ask the people within the group how they would deal with the situation if they were skills,

Donna  45:21
yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be good.

Nomin  45:26
Anyone else? Okay, so I'll move on to this section. So we continue with the education part of it. So talking about this downward spiral of pain, of this chronic pain. So you have this pain alert. You have thoughts like, "Oh, I'm such a bummer to be around because of my pain, and other people always having to help me with my pain". And then you have these feelings of embarrassment, guilt, frustration, and then that turns into an action of withdrawing from people, from activities and stuff like that. And we include this to know, to kind of just talk about how this is a normal thing that happens with people, and that you're not alone in experiencing this. And then here are some ways in which we can prevent additional burden and suffering. And so basically, learning how to make this downward spiral into an upward spiral and giving this new sort of spiral, I suppose so. These new thoughts of I now know how to pace myself while I'm walking and doing chores. This new feelings of happy, excited, new action. Um, this, again, is from the habit study where they're talking about walking, for example, but using meditation weekly in our instance. And then the goal is having less pain, less mood changes, and like, more practicing mindfulness based stuff.

Donna  47:13
Oh, that sounds great. If you can get rid of some of this pain, that would be wonderful. This is Donna.

47:21
So, are they going to be doing these different things in within the eight weeks, like these couple of weeks we're going to talk about this, the next couple of weeks we're going to talk about that. Or is it like study is going to be different? You understand what I'm saying?

Nomin  47:36
Yes. So each week we will have a specific theme. So for example, one week could be recognizing how you think of pain, and then another - which each week will go through different themes, but will have skills incorporated. So for example, recognizing how you think about your pain, and then having the skill of meditation. And then another week could be about how you cope with pain, and then having a skill of, let's say, like, I don't know, breathing, but each week we'll have different things so we can all work together to talk about all these eight new ways, for instance, to have have pain be less of a burden in your life. Does that answer your question?

Donna  48:30
I don't know if that answered her question, but having pain be less of a burden is a wonderful thing. I'm looking forward to it.

Janelle  48:36
Absolutely I agree.

Nomin  48:40
We're hoping. And then at the end of this introduction, we have this quote, you have a full and interesting life, chronic pain does not have to overshadow all aspects of your daily life. And as much as we all like this quote, we're hoping to bring in some voices from people that people know, because I'm not Tony, do you know whose quote is this from?

Tony Pham  49:08
This is actually from the original manual. I think it may have even just been there writing, and it may not be a specific quote. But in general, I think you raise a good point, which is like, how can we bring in the voices of people who might be most relevant to like the Roxbury and Dorchester community, as opposed to, like some random philosopher person in the mind, body space and whatnot.

Nomin  49:33
So what are people's thoughts on bringing voices that people are familiar with, people look up to, and is there, are there any? Do you guys have any favorite quotes or passages or scriptures that resonate with you all?

Janelle  49:46
Well, I like to respond on bringing down people like the lady said earlier. You know, we're all different. Our pain is different, and we react to our pain differently. So I like that factor here, how somebody else you know, because it may help you to figure out, well, you know what? Maybe, if I try that, it might work for me.

Nomin  50:19
So including people that we've interviewed as a part of the quotes can also be something that we can do. Yes, okay, wonderful.

Soraya  50:31
I agree. Cuz I think that like, I'm going to piggyback, everybody's pain so different that whoever is going through whatever, however they're doing, whatever they're doing to help it, to get better, or just to subside it for a little while, it's worth a try for the other people, because maybe whatever I'm doing is not right, or maybe someone else is doing is not helping, but maybe somebody else along the line has something to offer, and it might really help. So it's good to get other people's opinions and other people's thoughts of how they're doing things.

Nomin  51:11
Yeah, that makes sense. You make a really good point. I think also just having -thought they

Unknown  51:35
(Jumbled conversation)

Tony Pham  51:38
Miss Maria. Miss Maria. Is that you? All right, all right, we're good. (Zoom difficulties)

Nomin  51:48
Okay, just having people who have experienced the same issues, have experienced chronic pain, any sort of low mood, or anything like that, and having those people give those quotes would resonate with you all. This is what I'm hearing. I think

Donna  52:06
Exactly.

Nomin  52:08
Okay, so now we've finished up with the introductions before I move on to session one. Do you guys think that there's anything missing or anything that should be worked better on maybe not formatting wise, or anything like that?

Donna  52:32
Explain that question a little better.

Nomin  52:35
All right, so everything that we've talked about so far has mostly been the introduction. Are there things that you all would like to see changed or added or deleted or presented differently that you think would make the introduction better?

Genie  53:03
I mean, I kind of want to think that maybe if you incorporate a little bit more on pain, different levels of pain, different parts of the body, where, where you can incorporate with like one of the young ladies say, with different people coming in talking about different levels of pain. Like for myself, I cope with pain every day. It's pretty much of a the way of life for me. So if it can be in another, if it can be more clearer of you incorporating how to deal with pain on a regular basis, you know, I think that would be a good idea, a good way of helping, you know people like us or like me.

Donna  54:09
I think that, this is Donna, having more information about when, where, how everything is going to go about that would be better too.

Nomin  54:22
Okay, so more, like, logistics type of things?

Donna  54:24
Yeah like, "okay, so we're going to start doing this for the eight weeks on..." Well, you said that you would have to talk to us about what days and stuff like that, which days are available for people, but like, where we're going to do it and how we're going to do it would be, if we have more information about that, that would be much easier.

Nomin  54:49
Okay, so giving people some more information, diversifying people's pain experiences. Yeah? Anything else? Yeah. Okay, all right, so I'll go to session one.

Soraya  55:07
Well the compensation, that's always good.

Nomin  55:12
Okay, definitely. Sounds good. I'll spend a bit more time on session one than the other sessions, just because, yeah, we want more feedback on this one. So well firstly, I think session one mostly will just be about getting to know one another, being introduced to mindfulness and the overall program itself. Just because we're going to be spending eight weeks with each other. We want to create a community where people feel safe and open and there's a relationship between the participants, but also between the instructor and the participants too. So the first thing that we have here are some icebreakers. So this group introduction is called the connection game, which, yesterday we got some feedback, but I'd love to hear everyone else's opinions on some icebreakers that people might be more familiar with. But this connection game, people take turns sharing a story related to a hobby or activity they're interested in. Once one person shares, everyone responds with one sentence about the story, whether it's sharing something similar or questions, just so we can find common ground to get to know each other and build some connection. Any thoughts about either this icebreaker or any other icebreakers that people would be interested in?

Donna  56:47
So we're going to share stories about hobbies and activities and not about - I think if we're doing pain management, it would be better if we are sharing stories about different pain levels and and and where we're having pain at.

Unknown  57:12
Yeah. (in agreement)

Genie  57:19
What about when you're dealing with pain for multiple parts of your body? Because mine seems to be in my back and it's in my legs. So what about when you're dealing with pain and it's in different parts of your body instead of just one location?

Nomin  57:44
Tony, do you have anything to say?

Janelle  57:46
Well, I'm in agreement with Miss Genie, because, like she said, her whole body's in pain all the time, so it varies, probably from day to day about our pain level and where it is.

Nomin  58:07
And is that some -

Tony Pham  58:10
Yeah, you can go first, I'll follow up.

Nomin  58:13
Is that something y'all want to discuss as an icebreaker, or is this something y'all want to incorporate throughout the sessions?

Genie  58:24
I mean, I think it'd be, I think it'd be a good icebreaker.

Janelle  58:28
I agree this is Janelle. I agree.

Donna  58:32
This is Donna. I do too.

Genie  58:36
And this is, I'm sorry, this is Genie. So, yes,

Donna  58:39
yeah, yeah,

Soraya  58:43
Soraya, I agree too.

Donna  58:47
That's technically what we're there for, and like everybody's going to be talking and can we can relate to each other better that way.

Janelle  58:55
I agree. Janelle, yes,

Genie  58:59
So do I, Genie, yes,

Teri  59:02
Yes. Me too, so much. Can I ask a question?

Tony Pham  59:06
Oh, go for it.

Teri  59:07
Okay. When we're talking about an icebreaker question for the beginning of the thing, I don't know. I guess everybody's thing is different, or whatever. That's usually like something like you said to like, get to know each other, or whatever. Like, isn't that usually kind of like something that's a little bit more of a fun thing, not like going right into like, you know what I'm saying, like, because you said icebreaker, like, to get to know each other, whatever, certain things, what we have in common, whatever, whatever. And then I mean, correct me if I'm wrong. That's usually what an icebreaker is.

Donna  59:47
I think that's what we do have in common. Everybody has pain, so right, we're relating to each other.

Tony Pham  59:57
I appreciate that. All these thoughts. Honestly, I think that there's arguments that can be made on both sides. You know, as far as like, how to kind of get people comfortable with each other. And it almost makes me wonder if we should sort of even kind of leave it open ended, like, how people want to connect. I do know that, you know, as part of my participation at UCB and like Thursday group or coffee hour. You know, I always think about time too, and wanting to make sure that we make time for everyone. So maybe we can kind of kind of do a bit of both with the idea that, you know, us talking about our pain, our relationship to the pain is like an ongoing conversation throughout the program. And so what we might do, and I'm curious what y'all think about this as I'm kind of like processing what y'all are saying is we could incorporate, you know, sharing about your experience of pain, but not the whole story, because I think that that'll be something that we'll all sort of learn about each other as we as we continue talking throughout the program.

Janelle  1:01:14
I agree with that, Tony.

Genie  1:01:17
Yeah, Tony. I mean, I like that idea of as well, Doctor Tony. I'm sorry.

Multiple participants  1:01:17
(others agreeing)

Tony Pham  1:01:26
Hey, I also go by Mr. Tony.

Donna  1:01:32
I think Mr. Tony.

Tony Pham  1:01:34
I'm glad you mentioned that, because I do think that it's important for people to also understand that although we're all connected by this common issue that our experiences, whether due to fibromyalgia or some other pain condition, can make our pains different. And so sometimes it's good to know that information, especially as we're trying to share tips and ways to cope with pain, because sometimes things that work for you may not work for others, and knowing what they're going through, or knowing what you're going through, kind of kind of help us tweak that. But either way, I really appreciate this, and we can definitely incorporate, at least bringing in the idea of, like, why we're even in this program to begin with, right in that icebreaker stage, but keeping it short and also a little light hearted too, so that we can kind of get into that slowly throughout the span of the program. Yeah, we do have eight weeks.

Nomin  1:02:31
Okay, all right, so after the introductions and this icebreaker, we're going to be talking about some expectations, so sort of similar to the ground rules that we had previously talking about. We're here to support and communicate with each other. The primary goal is to really understand each other, participate, and that it's okay to take things in your own pace. What we share in the group, stays in the group, respect each other, care for each other, understand each other, just sort of ground rules, as I said. And then we kind of move on to the topic of mindfulness. So the entire manual and the program surrounds like the main idea of mindfulness, right? So we're going to be talking about brief introductions into mindfulness and how we can help. Most likely these will also be video formats. But we're going to be talking about how stressful events seem to happen, and we may not be aware of them, and they seem to unfold without our choosing, but automatic reactions can increase our distress. So just giving brief overviews about what is mindfulness and how it affects us on a daily basis, and how do I become mindful? So I'm not going to read all of this, but basically talking about a way to practice mindfulness is through meditation and possibly getting people's feedback about what meditation means for them. Just because everyone meditates differently, some people consider prayer to be a form of meditation and wanting to hear from everyone about ways in which they practice meditation, and also talking and emphasizing that mindfulness is an informal practice, which means you don't have to necessarily be, you know, crisscross listening to Frequency music and closing your eyes. This can be something that you do while you're washing dishes, eating, for example. So just making mindfulness into a normal habit that can be used and practiced daily.

Janelle  1:04:52
and Nomin, mindfulness is part of - I just forgot that - oh, breathing!

Nomin  1:05:01
Yes, we talk about that as well. How, yeah, do various breathing techniques and how to control your breath so that we become more mindful. But yeah, great point. And here we have this example of a mindfulness muscle. So as any other muscle. In order to strengthen this, you have to use it. Let me continue. So we have sort of diagrams like this a lot throughout our manual, talking about in this program, you learn how to switch from reacting to responding for example or judging or fixing, into observing or being avoidant, to accepting with curiosity, for example. All right, before I go into here, is there anything about everything that I've talked about so far in terms of mindfulness, what we will learn in the program that either stick out to you in the bad or a good light, anything that we should be aware of, or any just way to improve it really?

Genie  1:06:15
Well, this is Jeannie again, I know for me, there's certain things that I've done that kind of help with, well, it did help with my pain, like maybe we can incorporate some type of, some type of stretching, or some type of movement, because there's certain ways you can move your body and stretch your body that also can really, you know, relieve some pain. I mean, it worked for me. So I'm just wondering if that might be part of this, you know, be a part of what we're doing, what you're doing.

Nomin  1:07:00
Yeah, great point. I think we have one of our recordings, our sound recordings talks about mindful movement, and I think that might be the one that we're going to listen to, but I might be wrong on that, but there is some mention on it, but it's good to know that we should mention it earlier and emphasize it too.

Tony Pham  1:07:25
Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that. I do know I agree with Nomin that we do have recordings about being aware and mindful of our movements and activities, and those movements include things like walking or even gentle exercise, and the program that we're basing this off of, again, called mindfulness based cognitive therapy, it varies. Sometimes, as I've seen, when people deliver it, some people don't even have like physical exercises, people do like relaxation kind of stretching type exercises. And some people go far into like different yoga techniques. And I think that, given that this is going to be a program about chronic pain, we probably will scale down some of the exercises that are a bit more intense. But I do get the sense from what people are saying that, you know, there's some level of like, at least stretching exercises might be good to practice together, especially because they may add to our sense of relaxation, but also it could be a kind of mindful movement too, and I think we'd be happy to incorporate that, especially again, because we've seen people incorporate those exercises as part of the program in the past.

Janelle  1:08:39
I'd like to ask a question

Tony Pham  1:08:41
Go ahead

Talya  1:08:44
maybe we can do something like incorporate a healthier eating. Yeah, I say that because I did a detox and I was eating basically a plant based diet, but that thing caused my health to change. It changed my blood sugar numbers, it changed my blood pressure, things and stuff and my body went away. The inflammation that when the problems that was going on with my teeth. It actually corrected it. When I went back to the dentist, I was like, "are y'all going to fill these cavities?" They told me I didn't have any.

Tony Pham  1:09:34
Well, that's something I should work on too. I appreciate that, and I think that there's more evidence - go on.

Janelle  1:09:45
No, I just was going to add on to what she was saying. I was speaking to one of my aunts this morning. She's 84 years old, and she has arthritis, really, really bad in her knees, and sometimes she can't walk. So she changed her diet, and now she's and I don't know if this, I didn't say anything to her, but I wasn't sure, and I'm going to look into it myself. They were saying your joints and things are like the hinges on the door, and they need oiling every once in a while to prevent from, you know, squeaking and hurting. So she's been taking olive oil at night, and she said she can move better. And I mean, actually, but it's a high grade of olive oil. It's not just like, you know, one of the olive oils off the shelf. When she told me what it cost, it was crazy. But the the bottom line is, I'm in agreement with the lady about healthier eating, because a lot of times it will change all your numbers and doing some holistic things, and because all our foods are so contaminated, and it causes a lot of just different things in our body to react to the pain and things of that nature,

Tony Pham  1:11:19
I think that we can certainly create a space to talk about these issues. I think that it's interesting because I think that, on the one hand, we probably all know how to eat healthy, but it's hard to do, maybe because the places we live in, or just can't afford to the access to get, like affordable vegetables and high grade olive oil and those types of healthy foods. And I think also it seems like, you know, everyone here is juggling a lot, so sometimes their easy options are not always the healthiest. And so I think that's part of this program. We definitely will create a space to talk about, like, what is a healthy diet. But I also think that it might be more interesting to think about, how can we protect our decision making in a way, so that we can always kind of reach for the healthy option, if we can, via, like, finances and so forth. Because I imagine that might be the biggest barrier, sometimes, to healthy eating. But I do agree also, there are specific diets that do help people. Like, there's a lot of evidence for the like Mediterranean diet, which is a bit more it's less meat focused more on, like olive oil and those kinds of things. And so there's studies that support like that kind of diet, as well as similar diets for things like depression, inflammation and, by extension, chronic pain. So really thankful again that folks are bringing this up, and we can certainly remember to keep that in mind as we're putting this manual together. Back to you, Nomin.

Nomin  1:12:53
All right, so here are some of the more specific questions that we have. So we want to make this manual as engaging as we can, so just making sure that everyone is not only paying attention, but paying attention because it's fun and also because it's something that people want to get to know better. So I have questions about for the introduction as well as like session introductions. What are people's thoughts on video recordings, versus everything written out versus on a website? For example -

Janelle  1:13:34
This is Janelle. I like visuals, so I don't know about - I mean, I love to read too for backup, but I like visual.

Donna  1:13:45
Yeah, visual is even better. The video would be better rather than having to read everything for me - this is Donna.

Nomin  1:13:56
What are people's thoughts on having those videos -

Talya  1:14:00
Seeing things that you know need to be envisioned.

Donna  1:14:07
We missed what you said, Talya

1:14:14
I was saying that I agree with the visual. I said I am more of a visual learner, yeah, and I learn quicker when I see than if I have to do it another way.

Nomin  1:14:33
And we can always provide options for people who provide, uh, prefer to read or anything like that too. But what are people's thoughts on having these recordings on a website? For example -

Janelle  1:14:45
I don't have a problem with it. This is Janelle

Donna  1:14:50
Oh website, so that we could go in there and look at it and anytime we want it. Is that what you're saying?

Nomin  1:14:58
Yes

Donna  1:14:59
Oh well, that works too! Just go back and look at it all the time. You know? Yeah, yeah. The reminders, yeah, that sounds good.

Tony Pham  1:15:12
A part of the website too is that we want to make this something that can have legs of its own, that's sustainable within the community, and so we don't want to lock away the materials from people, even if they're not even in the program, but they might be interested in it and learning.

Janelle  1:15:17
Can I ask a question? So does that mean that once you do a website, that we can share it after the session, after the eight weeks, or can we share it in the middle, like, if you know somebody that's going through something, you know, friend of mines have blood cancer, and so she's always in a lot of pain. So she might not come on, because she might not want to, you know, be vocal, and don't want everybody to know what's going on, but if she could look at the website and read it for herself, it may help her. So will we be able to pass it on like that?

Tony Pham  1:16:12
That's my goal. I haven't gotten to that step yet, but I think that's ethically where I'd like to be, in the same manner that, you know, I may be a doctor, like in the clinic, but say, if someone comes up to me on the street and they're like, what's the deal with this medication? I like, I'll say something, you know, like, I'll share what I can. And I think that, you know, formally speaking, this program is meant for like, you know, in person or virtual engagement, but if other people are outside the program, out of our goodwill, if you want to share it, like, I think that's kind of what the direction we're we're going towards, and then hopefully, if that's  like, interesting to them, and the program is, at some point, like, offered in their community, they can, like, go and actually enroll and do it, hopefully at like, no cost, or some minimal cost. But yeah, that's partially what's informing us to do this website direction. We had also thought of it like as an app, but we're also mindful that sometimes people don't want to install more apps and things like that.

Janelle  1:17:10
Well, personally, I like the app and the website because I look at both, yeah, you know, yeah.

Soraya  1:17:22
I agree.

Genie  1:17:23
 I agree with Janelle as well.

Nomin  1:17:27
Thank you. That's great to hear about y'all being interested in the video recordings and the website and even the app. And I think I can assume that people would also be interested in having those audio recordings in the website as well. But what are people's thoughts on - so we want to learn these skills, and, for example, meditation audios do we actually want to listen to one of them right now?

Unknown  1:18:08
We can.

Nomin  1:18:09
Okay

Janelle  1:18:10
sure we can. Anything that helps you.

Nomin  1:18:15
Tony, do you want to paste the link?

Tony Pham  1:18:20
Yeah, I can paste it one sec. All right, so this is a five minute recording of audio taken from the manual that we're adapting from. And so what we'll do is I'll put the link in the the chat, and y'all can click on that link and individually watch it. It lasts about like five and some minutes. Um, so maybe we will just kind of take note it's like 2:23 and we can kind of come back here around 2:30 after we've listened to it. And I'd like everyone to just give your fresh appraisal, you know, like what worked or didn't work? About even listening to it, you could think about how long it is, the tone of the person's voice.

Genie  1:19:07
I lost you

Tony Pham  1:19:09
Oh can you hear me? Okay, now I don't -

Genie  1:19:11
Uh oh, I don't hear you. Doctor Tony, no, I can't.

Donna  1:19:21
I can hear you.

Soraya  1:19:24
I can hear you. I can hear you.

Genie  1:19:27
I can hear you now, but I didn't hear you for a while.

Tony Pham  1:19:29
Oh, it could have been my connection. Honestly, I don't actually even pay for internet at my house. I just get it for free through XFINITY. So I think that could be something with that. But hopefully, I just wanted to say there's a link in the chat, so click that and just listen to it for about five or so minutes. And we'll, we'll reconvene around 2:30 here, and y'all can give feedback on what you think about the recording. We didn't do it. It's from the original manual, actually. So we have a lot that we can change if need be well.  Will we be kicked out if we go on to that?  No, I think it's just like a YouTube video. So you can just kind of switch back on your phone or your tablet or your computer and just kind of leave the zoom in the background. I would just mute yourself so the video doesn't play to us.

Genie  1:20:15
So what? What's the name of it?

Tony Pham  1:20:19
Oh, the video? I put it in the chat. It's just like a five minute mindful walking video. So the person is going to walk you through how to be mindful of your movements as you're walking. And this is all part of the program with regard to just kind of being present and mindful as a way to cope with chronic pain. See, these are kind of like tools, basically.

Donna  1:24:36
Is anyone back?

Genie  1:24:40
I wasn't able to get in, so

Teri  1:24:44
I wasn't able to get in neither,

Genie  1:24:46
Yeah,

Tony Pham  1:24:48
like the video wasn't working for y'all?

Multiple participants  1:25:08
(participants navigating watching the clip)

Teri  1:25:48
That's alright. I'm good, because I've heard those kind of before, because I was in another study, and so they have those different types of, you know, tapes, so, whatever. So I've heard them. Plus I'm driving anyway, so.

Janelle  1:26:03
What I enjoyed was her voice. Her voice was soothing and relaxing, but I wanted to close my eyes doing it, but I'm walking, so you can't really close your eyes. But it also made me think about grounding, how she was talking about your toes and the heel of your foot hitting the ground. You know, because grounding is a part of therapy to heal your body. So I enjoyed it, and I'm like Teri, I listen to these things all the time. I love them because it's relaxing. And depending on the person that's speaking, they really can have you in touch or in tune to everything that they're saying, and you can, like, close your eyes and visualize it. That's what I got.

Teri  1:27:00
And they do have some of them where you can choose the voice, whether it be a man's voice, a woman's voice, or whatever. That's true, yeah,

Donna  1:27:08
Yeah, her voice is very soothing. I can say that. I think that I probably would want - I'm a more visual person, so even though listening to her, I probably will want to see her doing the motions also.

Tony Pham  1:27:30
Yeah, that came up last or yesterday too. And I think that's an interesting point we can certainly maybe do, like all of our content as videos and have audio versions of it, in case people just want something, like, similar to, like, a podcast after they've seen the video at least once. And maybe that could make things easier. And I also should mention, we'll try to practice these skills too, like, in the actual sessions, and hopefully that'll help give people an image of what they're doing.

Teri  1:28:05
That sounds good.

Tony Pham  1:28:08
Thank you.

Janelle  1:28:10
Yes, it does.

Tony Pham  1:28:12
It's also interesting to hear your thoughts about the voices too, because it's hard, I think to thinking about it, because I think different people will have different ideas about what's a relaxing voice, or what's a good way to like enunciate certain words, or even accents. Because I know some people aren't super keen on the voice, but it's interesting too, that the idea of having it like in different voices. I don't think we'll have the bandwidth to kind of record it several times in like a male voice or female voice, but we can certainly maybe add some variety to the recordings. The videos and like some of them might be by me or Denise or nomin or Mary.

Janelle  1:28:55
Well, I was just getting ready to say your voice is soothing as well. Doctor Tony, seriously, you have one of those captivating voice like, uh, EF Hutton, if you're talking, everybody be quiet.

Tony Pham  1:29:09
I appreciate you guys.

Teri  1:29:10
Maybe you can look up, you know that topic or discussion, and there might be some ones that are already out there, you know what I'm saying, that have male and female voices, or, I don't know if you specifically want to use your own, but there's probably because it's a popular thing. So there might already be some, you know, things out there already that specifically for pain or whatever that might be in different voices.

Tony Pham  1:29:37
Okay, I'm seeing this now, because I could see us just doing our own recordings. But yes, resources for people who, if you want a different voice, you can check out this one or something like that. Yeah, um, the only thing is, we might not reuse other people's just out of fear of, like, maybe there's like, some kind of copyright issue or something, and in that case, just want to step on people's toes. But we can certainly send people in that direction if they're looking for like a different way of interacting with the material.

Part 2: (last 30 minutes were transcribed separately due to Otter.ai rules)
Nomin  00:00
Do people have any preferences on time? Because I know that was a issue that was mentioned yesterday during our focus group about maybe that the 45 minute meditations might be too long. Maybe five minutes is too short or too long. What do you guys think is a perfect maybe middle ground for the amount of time that these audio recordings should be five to seven minutes?

00:40
Yeah, I was gonna say five to 10. Maybe, you know, it depends, yeah,

Donna  00:47
okay, yeah, no longer than that, right?

Nomin  00:51
That's sort of similar to what we heard as well.

00:54
because 45 minutes is a very long time, and we're in a session, so we're not getting the full gist of everything that's going on in session because we're listening to meditation or looking at a visual meditation tape or something video, you know.

Nomin  01:15
Yeah, that's also what we've heard where maybe an hour passes us by shorter than we have expected, so just making sure that we have equal amount of time for introductions, for learning the material, but also for doing the practice itself. So that's good to note down. I've already asked about the location, days of the week and website stuff in terms of language. So, for example, the use of the word chronic pain, depression, mindfulness meditation, does, do people see any concerning terms or things that we should be aware of, maybe not to use or maybe use a different word. For instance,

Donna  02:03
I don't see any problems with the wording that you use.

Janelle  02:16
I don't either. I was trying to say the same thing. Meditation is meditation, you know.

Nomin  02:22
Okay perfect.

Unknown  02:27
And then Genie was talking, but we couldn't hear her.

Genie  02:31
I'm sorry I was saying. I'm sorry I had myself on mute. You could tell I'm not computer literate. But anyway, I think chronic pain is chronic pain. The words you're using are fine with me. I mean, what other way can you word it? I mean, if you can, that's fine, but chronic pain is chronic pain. I mean, yeah,

Nomin  02:56
we've also heard from people just say it as it is. We're gonna have to discuss it either way,

Unknown  03:01
right, right, right.

Teri  03:06
You're not going to get 100% of whatever. But the main thing is, is finding solutions for people to help with their pain. Like the words don't mean anything, like sometimes we're focusing on the wrong thing. It's like, if they're giving you a resource to help you with your pain. Who cares what they call it?

03:23
And you know something, what I like about this particular group, and I only know two people on here, but what I like is that we are agreeing to disagree. I like that.

Genie  03:40
And Terry, you know you're absolutely right. I mean, pain is pain, correct? I feel you give me can get rid of my pain. I don't care what you call it, right?

Teri  03:51
The title is not the the end result, we're looking for solutions, right?

Nomin  04:01
Okay, that's good to know. Let me actually move on. We'll come back to the home practice materials. But since we're talking about names and terms and things that matter, just as long as we're getting the solution, we're actually wanting to see if anyone has any name ideas for this program in general. Here are some names that we have, or you might recognize the quiet focus as the name, but if we feel like something that's more maybe obvious, a feeling of healing, for example, was something that people mentioned yesterday, if people could drop some names in the chat, or just take turns saying any names that you think would be good, just to give you an overview of the program itself,

Janelle  04:54
The feeling of healing. No go, yeah. I like that. Feeling of healing is that sounds really good, because that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get healed.

Genie  05:07
I like I like the hoping and coping. I like that too. Yeah,

Nomin  05:16
there any ones that shouldn't be used?

Tony Pham  05:22
our feelings won't be hurt.

Genie  05:23
Yeah, living through pain we already living through should not. Should go somewhere because we're already going with pain or living with pain.

Donna  05:35
We don't need to be at we don't want that one.

Genie  05:44
I mean, why? Why would we have living with pain? Just like my sister said, we already know what we're living with. Yeah, so those two living can come off.

Tony Pham  05:56
Roger that

06:02
as Donna said, I like the community and health connection, because that's what it is, we're all community.

Janelle  06:07
I like that, yeah. I like the mindfulness head to toe pain to go, yes, yeah, that's nice as well.

Tony Pham  06:18
Okay, nice.

Teri  06:21
I think I like the examining the state of presence and self. I like that.

06:35
Oh yeah, that's nice, too. Yeah, yeah. I like that.

Tony Pham  06:40
Yeah, that was a Mary contribution, so we can thank her for that.

Multiple participants  06:47
Thank you, Mary.

Nomin  06:53
So throughout the rest of the call, if anyone has any name ideas that just pop up randomly, feel free to write it in the chat, any sort of ideas help, just because I don't know, we want to make this named something catchy, something that makes sense and people, something that people would resonate and want to attend. But I'll go back to what was it? Where did we leave off? The home practice exercises. So another thing in terms of making this program more engaging, more fun, is these home practice exercises. And so for example, this is an example of what one of the exercises could look like. So mindful, eating, being bringing awareness to the sensations as you are eating, doing this at least for one meal or snack a day. And then here you have this table where you write down the sensations your thoughts while you were eating, any emotions or feelings that come up and any behaviors or actions you want to take, such as lifting your fork or spoon. What are people's thoughts on -

Teri  08:14
I was asking. Do you want us to fill this out and send this back to you?

Nomin  08:19
No, this is an example of a home practice exercise within the program. So let's focus on the actual mindful eating and the table. But more so I want to hear everyone's opinions on this type of format for these exercises.

08:37
Well, you know, when we did our mindfulness class, one of the doctors had us to hold a raisin in our hand for about 20 minutes, and when we held the raisin in our hand for 20 minutes, he had us to put it in our mouth. Well, I didn't understand it at first, and I still don't understand it today, I put the raisin in and everybody wanted to talk about what the raisin did in their mouth, but my hand was sticky. I didn't like the feeling of the you know, after holding the raisin for 20 minutes in my hand, my hand became sticky from the raison, and nobody even talked about that, but that was part of the class anyway. I just thought I'd share that.

Tony Pham  09:27
It's really funny. It reminds me of when I went to my first wake and had to take communion, and I was like, I've never taken Communion before. No one was talking to me about putting a cracker in my mouth, but I was thankful to have the education. I appreciate you bringing that up, and we can certainly give people a space to talk about during the session what might be pain points in terms of the actual exercises, such as like having to hold on to something sticky for 20 minutes. As far as these exercises, we're also thinking about them as extensions to do at home. And kind of what Nomin was also wanting to get feedback on is like, how can we make home practice more engaging? You know, outside of maybe making the exercises themselves engaging, but like, what about the format? Is filling stuff out going to be painful, you know? Because sometimes I know that just the process of having to actually do work at home might make the program less engaging. I know, like sometimes therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT, they actually like assign homework, and that might be intimidating. So curious about what people think about the idea of homework in general as part of a program. What are the issues with having homework? Would homework be better if it was done like with a partner in the program as well? Would that make it less painful? Would it be less painful to have homework that's not required, but maybe suggested, and a lot of times the homework is about just practice again outside of, you know, the session, and even sharing your experiences or recording them down so that you can remember what they were and share them back with the group the next time we meet. So yeah, what thoughts about that? Oh, Miss Janelle, your mic is off.

Janelle  11:23
homework pertaining to our pain level or homework exercise or what?

Donna  11:32
I don't think homework is good at all.

Tony Pham  11:35
Okay, I also don't like homework, um, so just -

Genie  11:41
I'm gonna tell you right now. I don't even want to mess with the word, I don't want to mess with the word homework.

Janelle  11:46
But I was just asking a question, because I was in another study, and they had us to journal instead of doing homework. You had zero to five minutes, or five to 10 minutes or 10 to 15 minutes, and that's different than homework. That's what I was trying to say. Because I'm not. I mean, I went to college and school, I don't want to do no homework no more.

Tony Pham  12:15
Yeah, honestly, I don't like homework either. Um, yeah, maybe.

Donna  12:19
So maybe if you say journaling instead of saying homework, maybe it would be a whole lot better, you know, because you're doing it at home, correct? But you're doing something different. So if you say journaling instead of saying homework because that makes a big difference, yeah.

Tony Pham  12:39
Okay, but people here will be okay with the idea of, like, even finishing a session and in between, like journaling at home or or just doing some practices, or some of the techniques at home, and kind of journaling about their experience with it.

Janelle  12:53
Sure I would.

12:55
Yeah, I like the idea - *(multiple participants talking so couldn't comprehend)

Genie  13:02
I like the idea, Doctor Tony, of working with someone else.

Janelle  13:07
I like that as well too.

Genie  13:10
Yeah, I do better when I'm with someone else. And I have to do something.

Tony Pham  13:15
yeah. I was thinking about that kind of reflecting on just, you know, life general, and you were saying something?

Soraya  13:24
No, sorry, you were talking. So I stopped.

Tony Pham  13:27
Oh, okay, I will finish soon. I was just saying I'd like the idea of working with someone too, because it can kind of make that work a bit more engaging, because you're actually like communicating with someone. We'll try to keep that in mind too. Didn't mean to interrupt you, too. What were you going to say? Ms. Soraya?

Soraya  13:44
I said it's good to be as a team.

Janelle  13:48
Yes, that's true too. Even in journaling, you understand as a team and what you went through for the day and how you like the exercise.

Tony Pham  14:01
Hmm. And then when it comes to, like, working with somebody, there is some ideas that, you know, that come to mind, like, one of which is like, you know, after every session, you just kind of choose someone in the group, and you kind of talk through the homework together. Another is, like, there could be, like, some kind of online group chat, where people can just kind of post their reflections to the group, and that can kind of create that sense of community in between sessions. I'm curious how y'all think, kind of like doing home practice, or some practicing some of these skills at home might be more engaging in like a person to person context. What any of those ideas track, or maybe there's a different idea. I like the person to person.

Genie  14:46
I like the person, the person contact.

Janelle  14:48
Yeah, I like that as well.

Genie  14:51
Because there's two people that I can definitely work with. They're so very informative and so resourceful, and I know one of them know who I'm talking about, you know, but anyway, that'll work good for me.

Tony Pham  15:05
Yeah, yeah. And we're thinking it probably would be with other people currently in the program, just because. And so maybe what we can do is we can make space or time at the end of each session for folks to kind of say, like, okay, like, turn to the person to your right, and you two can find it some time to connect, during like the week and just chat about your experience, uh, practicing meditation or practicing mindfulness and things like that.

15:34
Well, Doctor Tony, it's only going to be eight of us, correct?

Tony Pham  15:39
Yeah.

Janelle  15:40
Out of the whole group? Well, I mean, I don't know how everybody else feels. Where everybody would like to, you know, do it with somebody else. How would it be if we all just decided to do it as a group and have our input in, like, whatever, after session, even if we had to call and do on a chat, yes, if you had to do a group chat and that way, because we're all in the same session, that we, you know, would help all of us to grow and to get knowledge from one another to, you know, continue in the program and like, I mean, grow, help us with our pain and whatever it is that we're going through, the mindfulness, the meditation, the exercising, mentally or physically. You know, I just thought I'd ask, that's all,

Tony Pham  16:40
yeah, I think that's that's definitely a cool idea. We can look into, like, some of the technology that we can use for it. Obviously, there's just, like, regular text messaging, but if we do go down that route, we'll probably implement it in something like a group chat then. And so I'm glad that there's some interest in that.

Nomin  17:00
How do people feel about incorporating a lot of different types of these home exercises? So for example, maybe while also having a group chat, you journal, and then when you come to these sessions, you pair up with a buddy and you talk about what you journaled about. So having like different ways to kind of connect with others, but also do these homeworks

Janelle  17:23
not the homework, journaling. I'd like the connection, you know, I like what you're saying. I think it would be great to connect.

Genie  17:36
Yeah, I think it's good to connect. I mean, for me, it's a good thing for me. You know, when I connect with others that are in the same situation than I am, that helps me a lot more than just being by myself trying to figure things out.

Nomin  17:54
Okay, perfect. So one of the last things, I think, except, yeah, one of the last things that we'll sort of talk about is some materials. So again, similar to the example of the case study about Miss Linda, we want to include some quotes and passages from wherever that relate to the things that we talk about. If anyone has any ideas for who we can go to for various quotes or passages or famous things within the community that would be important to mention, for example, like perhaps the Serenity Prayer, or including voices from within the community, too. But yeah, what are people's thoughts on this?

18:47
I like quotes. I like the serenity pair prayer, because we can't change, you know, things that we cannot change.

Genie  18:56
And I also like Maya Angelou, she had so many, yes, spiritual, non spiritual  quotes. I mean,her words are just outstanding. And I think for me it will work good with this program. Oh, definitely, yeah, to have some of her words, her quotes and scriptures, or whatever. You know, she does poems. I mean, she's a powerful speaker, woman, and I think we all might get something out of some using some of her stuff.

Donna  19:29
exactly, definitely.

Janelle  19:31
I agree. I agree too.

Nomin  19:34
Perfect. I think we have included a Maya Angelou quote for one of our newer iterations. So that tracks well. Anyone else that you think would be inspirational?

Genie  19:50
Yeah, the heavenly Father, Amen.

Tony Pham  19:57
Yeah? Any particular like Psalms or passages or scripture that y'all particularly find, you know helpful to you during periods where you you might want to practice mindfulness or awareness of the situation again, like, I know the Serenity Prayer is a popular one, but I know that there's often less cited passages from like scripture, Bible or other religions that might be inspirational or helpful.

Genie  20:24
Well, for me, I read Psalms 91 every day, and that that just does something for me and my spirit. So I mean, I don't know what it might do for others, but that's one of my, my spiritual quotes that I read every day.

Janelle  20:44
I read Psalms as well, but I also read well, it may not even deal with this, but I did a lot of different scriptures in the Bible that I like you know that I say to myself, like once about, you know, God, I need you to help me, especially when I'm in pain and nothing else is working. So, you know, I lean on him different things.

Tony Pham  21:15
Yeah, thank you.

Janelle  21:19
You're welcome.

Nomin  21:21
Okay, okay, all right, so the last things that we have are just session by session. And I'm not sure if we have time to go through each of the sessions right now, but just to give like an overview. And session two will be talking about being aware of our body and having automatic reactions to things and learning how to be more present in the moment by practicing mindfulness. These are some examples. Session Three will be called gathering the scattered mind, so shifting from doing to being using mindfulness. Session Four is recognizing thinking so noticing when we start getting caught in negative thought patterns and using mindfulness to stay present and cope with stress. And then session five talks about thoughts are not facts, so understanding that the negative thoughts that we have are not facts all the time, and giving space to respond to stress in a better way, using the skills that we talk about. Session Six, allowing and letting be, so allowing our feelings to be as they are, using techniques to stay mindful and grounded, as someone else mentioned. And then session seven, taking care of myself, so noticing any signs of burnout, stress, pain and knowing how to best take care of ourselves. And then session eight will be the last session, talking about maintenance and talking about how we can maintain all the skills and all the things that we learn about within our daily life after the end of the program, so something that helps us stick with the skills for hopefully the rest of our lives. And that is what I have here. Any last thoughts from anyone, and I also want to take make sure that everyone stays for a little bit, just because I want to mention about a different study that people might be interested in. But for now, does anyone have last thoughts? Things that we should know. Just open the discussion up to people, and if you guys have any questions as well.

Janelle  23:48
No, I'm good. I enjoyed this. I enjoyed the session today, this focus group, I really did, and I hope that I could be a part of that eight week session.

Tony Pham  24:04
Yes, ma'am, well we'll definetly send out -

Genie  24:12
Actually your sessions, you know, they helped me Tony, so I hope (unable to hear due to lag)

Teri  24:26
And you said around November, December?

Tony Pham  24:29
Yeah, we're thinking about enrolling, let's see, probably late November, with a roll out around late December. Of course, things sometimes change, depending on how slow or fast we can kind of get these materials completed, but that's our goal. And again, just because of limited spots, if we do turn to our original group, we'll probably have to do some kind of, like physical lottery systems, or like some kind of transparent thing, because I would love to enroll everyone. But even if we can't get you via that kind of system, I'm happy to kind of direct you to some of our, like, sister studies, or some of the other things going on in CHOIR that, quite frankly, are very similar, but just have, like, a different direction in terms of, like, their approach.

Teri  25:11
Okay, yeah. But like I said, if you're going to have multiple, you know, hopefully everybody will get a chance to participate in at least one of them. You know what I mean. So yeah, multiple, yeah.

Janelle  25:22
I agree. I agree with that too.

Teri  25:24
Yeah, yeah. The first eight get this one. The next one will be the whatever. The next eight get whatever. So, yeah, that's good, as long as we get a chance to participate in at least one of them.

Tony Pham  25:35
Speaking of other studies, Nomin, you said you have another one you wanted to share?

Nomin  25:38
 (going on about HB-CA study then goodbyes)
