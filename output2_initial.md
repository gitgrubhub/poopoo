In adapting mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for older Black adults living with chronic pain and co-morbid early cognitive decline, thematic analysis of focus group discussions revealed four overarching themes emphasizing the nuanced relationship between cognitive challenges and pain management. Participants emphasized how existing adaptations for co-morbid depression offer a foundational start but stressed the necessity of further tailoring to accommodate memory-related difficulties, cognitive load, and sustaining engagement amid cognitive decline. These themes include: (1) Flexible and multimodal program delivery to accommodate cognitive limitations; (2) Instructor characteristics emphasizing cognitive support and cultural concordance; (3) Tailored mindfulness and movement practices that integrate memory-friendly adaptations; and (4) Cognitive-behavioral components adapted to enhance comprehension and recall. Each theme and sub-theme is explicated below with representative quotes to illustrate community perspectives.

### Flexible and Multimodal Program Delivery to Support Memory Challenges

**Shorter, Chunked Content Delivery**  
Participants strongly advocated for breaking session content into brief, digestible segments to align with memory limitations. Long sessions or extensive materials risked overwhelm, disengagement, and cognitive fatigue. As one participant noted, *"If someone can only watch three minutes now, three later, it’s easier to absorb and remember… When we’re dealing with mood and pain and memory issues, smaller chunks just make sense."* This emphasis was especially important for recordings and video content intended for home practice.

**Hybrid and Accessible Formats**  
Given mobility and cognitive impairments, participants valued the availability of in-person sessions supplemented by virtual or telephone access to maintain continuity amid fluctuating memory and health states. A participant shared, *"When people have challenges with memory, even just being able to attend could be hard on some days. It helps to have more than one way to join in."* Accessibility through multiple modalities was perceived as essential for sustained participation.

**Repetition and Recap as Memory Aids**  
Reinforcing key concepts through frequent summaries, reminders, and recaps was proposed as pivotal to overcoming forgetfulness across sessions. Consistent prompts helped anchor learning and encouraged practice adherence. One community expert remarked, *"It’s easy to forget what was said the week before. Reminders, recaps, and repeating the exercises help a lot."*

### Instructor Characteristics with Emphasis on Cognitive and Cultural Support

**Patience, Empathy, and Cognitive Sensitivity**  
Participants underscored the importance of facilitators who understand both cultural contexts and the cognitive difficulties frequently co-occurring with chronic pain. The instructor’s demeanor significantly influenced comfort and willingness to engage. As expressed by a participant, *"If the instructor understands where we’re coming from, and they get that sometimes we forget, it feels safer to ask questions or admit we’re confused."*  

**Clear Language and Stepwise Guidance**  
The group preferred instructors who avoided jargon, used plain language, incorporated visual aids, and paced sessions to allow participants time to process. Checking for understanding and encouraging participants to reflect or repeat material were beneficial. A community member emphasized, *"Don’t just say it once and move on. Make sure we’re following, maybe even let us repeat things back."*

### Mindfulness and Movement Practices Adapted for Cognitive Support

**Mindfulness Embedded in Daily Routines**  
Mindfulness exercises were favorably received when integrated with familiar routines and activities, which enhanced relevance and ease of recall. *"You have to connect the exercises to things we already do… maybe a walking mindfulness or something we can remember,"* one participant recommended. These adaptations promoted sustainability of practice despite cognitive impairment.

**Use of Multi-Sensory Cues and Group Dynamics**  
Visual aids, tactile props, music, rhythms, and shared group exercises were seen as valuable methods to support memory and engagement. *"When you see it, hear it, or do it together, it sticks better… those kinds of exercises really help folks who forget,"* a community expert observed, highlighting the synergistic benefits of multi-modal stimuli and peer interaction.

### Cognitive-Behavioral Content Tailored for Understanding and Memory Retention

**Simplified Concepts and Gradual Introduction**  
Participants cautioned against introducing complex psychological terms or multiple new concepts in a single session, which could amplify confusion. Instead, building understanding through one concept at a time with relatable examples was preferred. One participant shared, *"Please don’t make us have to remember big words or too many steps. Just one clear thing to work on, with examples, goes a long way."*

**Visual and Written Memory Supports**  
Supplemental materials such as illustrated handouts, summary sheets, and brief checklists were recommended to reinforce learning for home use. Moreover, technological reminders via phone or mail were seen as promising tools to bolster adherence. As stated, *"Give us something we can take home and look at. Or send a reminder in the mail or on the phone. It’s easy to forget unless you see it again."*

**Peer Support to Enhance Recall and Motivation**  
Group discussions and peer explanations helped participants clarify and retain content, reinforcing learning through social interaction. One participant noted, *"After someone repeats what was said, you remember more. It helps to talk it out or have someone else explain it again in their words."*

***

### Group Support and Normalization of Cognitive Challenges

**Creating a Supportive Environment for Memory Struggles**  
Participants emphasized normalizing forgetfulness and encouraging open dialogue about cognitive challenges within the group to reduce stigma and isolation. *"We need to be told—forgetting is normal, and it’s okay to ask again. Everyone in the group should help each other remember,"* articulated a community member.

**Incorporation of Community Resources for Cognitive Health**  
Access to referrals, community-based memory aids, and education about cognitive health were identified as critical adjuncts to MBCT to holistically address the pain-cognition interplay. One participant affirmed, *"If there’s something out there to help, we want to know. Memory is tough on top of pain, so anything extra helps."*
