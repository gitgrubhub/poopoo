Abstract
Introduction
Older Black adults experience disproportionately high rates of chronic pain (CP) and depression, yet inequities in access, recognition, and culturally resonant treatment persist. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based group intervention for depression with emerging promise for CP. However, adaptations for older Black adults with this co-morbid CP-depression remain underexplored.
 
Methods
Guided by Community-Based Participatory Research principles, we conducted four Community Engagement Studios with 21 older Black adults in Boston (ages 51-84), all reporting CP (≥ 3 months) and mild to moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 15). Participants reviewed MBCT content and reflected on cultural relevance, barriers, and facilitators. Through thematic analysis of recorded transcripts, we identified themes pertaining to their perceptions of MBCT.
 
Results
Three themes emerged: (1) preference for flexible, sustainable delivery (community-based, hybrid options, shorter sessions); (2) importance of instructors who are grounded in respect and shared cultural context; and (3) nuanced acceptance of mindfulness practices when adapted to faith, physical limitations, and language.
 
Discussion
Our findings highlight MBCT’s feasibility for older Black adults with the CP–depression comorbidity when adapted for cultural resonance, accessibility, and sustainability. Results will directly inform our adaptation of MBCT for the CP-depression co-morbidity among older Black adults.

Introduction
Chronic pain (CP), lasting three months or longer, is a leading cause of disability worldwide (Scholz et al., 2019). In the U.S., one in five adults experiences CP, but prevalence is disproportionately higher among older Black adults, reaching up to 78% (Bazargan et al., 2016; Robinson-Lane & Booker, 2017). CP is strongly linked to depression, with nearly 5% of U.S. adults reporting both conditions simultaneously (Heer et al., 2014). This comorbidity impairs functioning, increasing risks for isolation and reduced independence in older Black adults (De La Rosa et al., 2024; Pham, Doorley, et al., 2023).

Older Black adults suffer greater CP burden due to socioeconomic disparities, including financial constraints and transportation barriers hindering treatment access (Baker et al., 2008; Bazargan et al., 2016). Clinicians often underrecognize pain and depression in this group due to communication differences and implicit bias (Bair et al., 2008; Shavers et al., 2010). These challenges combine with cultural stigma around depression, fewer culturally competent clinicians, and systemic inequities, resulting in poorer outcomes compared to White counterparts (Pham, Doorley, et al., 2023).

Psychosocial interventions are critical to interrupting the cycle of worsening CP and depression (De La Rosa et al., 2024). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which integrates cognitive-behavioral skills with mindfulness practices, has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing depression, improving coping skills, and enhancing quality of life (Kuyken et al., 2008; Segal et al., 2012). MBCT encourages present-moment awareness and self-compassion, offering particular value for individuals with CP by reducing pain interference and rumination (Garland et al., 2016; Pinto et al., 2024). Its alignment with spirituality and communal healing also suggests cultural resonance for Black communities (McCracken et al., 2001).

Although MBCT shows promise for comorbid CP and depression, few studies target older Black adults, even though they face heightened risk (Pei et al., 2021). Existing trials often feature limited sample sizes and short follow-up. Critically, MBCT has not been systematically adapted for the cultural and contextual needs of this group. Very few studies have incorporated community perspectives, leaving a gap in understanding cultural fit and acceptability (Barrera Jr. et al., 2013).

To address these inequities, Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is recommended. CBPR is defined as “an approach in which researchers and community members share power and responsibility across all phases of research” (Oetzel et al., 2015). This method builds trust, ensures relevance, and enhances intervention sustainability by involving communities in defining research questions, shaping interventions, and disseminating results (Wallerstein et al., 2019). For older Black adults, CBPR helps ensure interventions reflect lived experiences, cultural practices, and structural realities.

Guided by CBPR principles, this study aimed to explore perceptions of MBCT among older Black adults experiencing CP and depression using Community Engagement Studios (CE Studio). Partnering with Union Capital Boston and a community navigator, we sought to elicit perspectives on MBCT’s relevance, cultural appropriateness, and feasibility. Findings will inform a future adaptation of MBCT that prioritizes inclusivity, cultural resonance, and health equity, with the ultimate goal of enhancing its effectiveness for the CP-depression co-morbidity among older Black adults.

Method
Participants
Participants were recruited utilizing purposive sampling to ensure the inclusion of older Black adults (≥ 50 years old) experiencing chronic musculoskeletal pain (≥ 3 months, pain severity ≥ 4 on the Numeric Rating Scale; Williamson & Hoggart, 2005) and mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9, score 5–14; Manea et al., 2015). Recruitment occurred from June to August 2023. Exclusion criteria included moderately severe/severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 15), substance abuse/dependence, significant cognitive impairment (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Pfeiffer, 1975), and previous extensive exposure to CBT/mindfulness-based programs. None of the participants refused to participate or dropped out. Participants received compensation for participation and travel.

Measure
We adopted the CE Studio methodology, which prioritizes bidirectional learning and active co-creation with our participants as community experts throughout each session (Joosten et al., 2015; Wallerstein et al., 2017). During each CE Studio, we solicited perceptions of MBCT for older Black adults with co-morbid CP and depression. We demonstrated or together practiced core MBCT concepts and skills for CP (Day, 2017) and depression (Segal et al., 2012). Our multidisciplinary team created a semi-structured interview guide to elicit rich, narrative accounts and perceptions of MBCT from older Black adults with CP and depression. Questions focused on community readiness (“Have you heard about prior successful efforts at targeting CP or depression through mindfulness skills and cognitive therapy?”), design features (“How might we improve MBCT to better engage older Black adults with CP and depression who are not as experienced with mindfulness and cognitive therapy?”), adoption (“Which MBCT components resonated with you?”), and sustainability (“Evaluating benefits and expenses, how much should the program charge?”). 

CE Studio agendas established clear, inclusive objectives; encouraged open dialogue, rapid feedback, and collaborative reflection; and ensured all voices were heard and respected. We incorporated other participatory activities such as brainstorming, mapping, and prototyping to invite creativity and build solutions that reflected community-identified needs. We shared back synthesized input with our participants for iterative feedback and refinement. The research team facilitated a total of four CE Studios across 21 participants, with each CE Studio averaging 134 minutes (range: 119–152 minutes) and 5 participants per CE Studio.

Procedure
All CE Studios were hybrid and simultaneously delivered virtually using HIPAA-approved Zoom video calls and in-person at local sites (e.g., public library space) to maximize cultural resonance and community trust. No other individuals were present except for the participants and research team. We did not conduct repeat CE Studios. A male MD, MScGH-level clinical psychiatrist (TVP) lead facilitation of all CE Studios. The facilitator has a clinical and research background in CP, depression, mind-body interventions, and integrated health. The facilitator was cognizant of potential bias resulting from the discrepancy between his main work in an academic medical center to this community setting. Community experts were made aware of the facilitator's personal and professional background and reasons for conducting this research. 

A research assistant (NE) and the MGB Director of Diversity Recruitment (MK) co-facilitated each CE Studio. The research assistant collected field notes and audio recorded all CE Studios. We then deidentified and transcribed all audio recordings verbatim. Field notes supported Rapid Data Analysis (RDA), thematic saturation checks, and further qualitative assessment. RDA involved deductively mapping field notes and observations onto a template summarizing the interview guide (Gale et al., 2013, p. 20). We used a secure qualitative data analysis platform (Dedoose version 9.0.107) to store and code the deidentified transcripts (Salmona et al., 2019). 

We obtained local Institutional Review Board approval prior to the conduct of this study (Protocol #: 2023P000237). All participants were provided informed consent, and confidentiality was strictly maintained during data collection, analysis, and dissemination, in accordance with ethical research standards. Lastly, we followed the Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research in acquiring, analyzing, and reporting on qualitative data to promote rigor of our qualitative methods (Tong et al., 2007).

Data Analysis
We carried out our qualitative analysis using the Framework Method (Gale et al., 2013, p. 20), guided primarily by a deductive approach (Braun & Clarke, 2006) while remaining open to novel insights introduced by community collaborators. The process began with verbatim transcription of all interviews (Step 1). In Step 2, the lead author (TVP) and two research assistants (NE, DAT), who had either conducted, observed, or reviewed most CE Studios, thoroughly familiarized themselves with the material.

Steps 3 and 4 focused on developing and refining the coding framework. Initially, each researcher (TVP, NE, DAT) independently constructed a codebook using a hybrid inductive–deductive process. Parent codes such as “perceptions of mindfulness practices” were identified deductively, drawing on MBCT’s structure, content, and delivery format. Additional parent-codes (e.g., "instructor characteristics") and sub-codes (e.g., “perceptions of mindfulness practice," "adaptations for mindful movement”) were generated both through prior research on MBCT, CP, depression, and health disparities (Pham, Doorley, et al., 2023; Pham, Kincade, et al., 2023) and inductive engagement with the current dataset and RDA. The team then met to compare and consolidate their preliminary versions into one shared codebook. 

Afterward, each researcher applied this working codebook to one transcript and to the RDA matrix summary, which informed further revisions. Using that refined version, all three independently coded 20% of the transcripts. During this first round, the team continued to add and adjust codes as unanticipated ideas surfaced. They later convened to review the consistency of their coding, resolve discrepancies through discussion, and incorporate emergent codes into an updated version of the codebook.

In Step 5, NE and DAT applied the finalized hybrid codebook to recode the initial 20% and complete coding of the remaining transcripts, with TVP providing ongoing guidance and oversight. For Step 6, coded excerpts were exported from Dedoose to local, encrypted storage to construct a framework matrix. Finally, in Step 7, all three researchers independently reviewed the extracted data, generated summary codes, and organized these into preliminary themes and subthemes. They then met collectively to discuss patterns, refine interpretations, and finalize the thematic framework. Participants were not available to later comment or revise the transcripts and qualitative findings.

Results
We conducted 4 CE Studios to explore community expert perceptions of MBCT for the CP-depression co-morbidity among older Black adults. Each CE Studio included 5-6 community experts and explored their experiences and perceptions of MBCT delivered to older Black adults with co-morbid CP and depression. 

Demographic Variables
Twenty-one older Black adults participated as community experts, ranging in age from 51 to 84 years (average 68 years old), with a majority being female (85%). Most were Protestant Baptist (60%), while the remainder represented other Christian faiths. Education was primarily at the high school level (60%), with others holding college or vocational degrees. A majority of participants grew up in Dorchester, Roxbury (40%), or Boston (25%), Massachusetts, with the remainder coming from surrounding regions. At the time of our CE Studios, all community experts resided in Dorchester or Roxbury, two neighboring areas in the Greater Boston Area with substantially diverse populations. 

Qualitative Results
Thematic analysis of the CE Studio transcripts revealed three main themes: (1) preference for flexible and sustainable program delivery, (2) the importance of instructors rooted in respect and shared cultural context, and (3) nuanced acceptance of mindfulness practices (Figure 1).

[ Insert Table 1. Illustrative Quotes from the Community Engagement Studios ]

Theme: Preference for Flexible and Sustainable Program Delivery
Sub-theme: Self-Sustainability Through Community-Based Delivery
Community experts stressed ongoing engagement rather than short-term involvement.  They emphasized the importance of embedding MBCT programs or “workshops” within community settings, rather than limiting them to research initiatives, the need for sustained and respectful relationships, and for the program to remain in the community after the end of the research. Community experts emphasized MBCT should be free or low cost, especially for disabled or financially limited members. Community experts further cited caregiving, meals, and childcare as ideas for holistic cost-cutting support. 

To reduce delivery costs, community experts encouraged training community-based lay instructors and maintaining partnerships with community-based organizations. Community experts recommended clear group norms to ensure safety, respect, open dialogue, confidentiality, and active listening. Overall, community experts stated that the goal of MBCT should be sustainable impact and empowerment rather than short-term gains.

Sub-theme: Incorporate Group Support and Community Resources
For our community experts, generational experiences with pain and coping shaped preferences for peer support and resource sharing. They described how “breaking cycles of silence” and “tough love” through vulnerability, communal healing, and educational exchange is vital for empowerment and resilience. For example, community experts underscored that stigma surrounding mental health and depression within the Black community complicates access to care. They advocated for an MBCT program that openly addresses stigma and normalizes conversations on mental health, thereby dismantling barriers to engagement. 

To further enhance the group dynamic, community experts suggested incorporating known community traditions. For example, community experts recommended integrating shared meals or snacks during meetings to enhance social bonding and create a welcoming atmosphere. Similarly, community experts suggested providing certificates of completion during a group ceremony to validate participants’ effort, boost morale, and offer tangible acknowledgment. 

While community experts appreciated the list of outside resources as part of pre-existing MBCT programs, they strongly advocated for updated, more comprehensive, and customized resources to ground the program in real-world applicability and local, culturally relevant services and supports. Because the older Black community may already be engaged in sharing resources and narratives, community experts encouraged a program format in which attendees could offer resource suggestions to each other.

Alongside sharing practical resources, contributors also discussed the need for openness towards community-accepted, holistic solutions. For example, many community experts highlighted their use of alternative medicine, traditional remedies, and faith, reinforcing the importance of open dialogue about diverse ways to manage pain and heal depression while nurturing belonging, resilience, and hope within the community. 

Sub-theme: Shorter Sessions with Flexible Arrival and Departure Times  
Opinions on session length varied; while some community experts felt two hours was reasonable, others voiced difficulty managing longer meetings or frequent attendance over several weeks. Community experts viewed shorter sessions as a practical concession to accommodate attendees with health and logistical constraints including older adults with the CP-depression co-morbidity. In addition to session abbreviation, community experts also called for buffer periods to reflect the need for practical and manageable time commitments, with flexibility for late arrivals, longer conversations, and networking opportunities.    

Sub-theme: In-Person Options at Thoughtful Locations
Our community experts preferred local, in-person meetings for accessibility and comfort, suggesting venues like community centers, schools, libraries, and parks, particularly in underserved neighborhoods. Being physically present while interacting with physical intervention materials, according to our community experts, would foster connection, trust, and interpersonal relationships. Community experts recommended rotating locations to improve inclusivity. While some acknowledged the important role of virtual sessions and online materials for those comfortable with technology or mobility issues, the majority preference was for face-to-face, community-based programming with print materials.

Sub-theme: Online Options for Accessibility and Convenience
Our community experts emphasized the need for flexibility, recognizing that health, pain, and transportation challenges could affect attendance. Hybrid formats, including virtual options, community experts argued, would help accommodate emergencies and inclement weather, making MBCT programs more accessible to older Black adults with CP and depression. Community experts also noted how integrating activities into home environments would foster independence and retention of skills.  Program materials, community experts advised, should be offered not only in print but via an easy-to-navigate website accessible on diverse devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, and easily editable by program administrators to reflect changes in the community. Integrating audio and video content into familiar video streaming platforms was highlighted to mitigate technology barriers, foster familiarity, and boost participation. Overall, while the majority of our community experts preferred traditional in-person gatherings and print materials, many still valued virtual attendance and easily accessible online materials for those unable to travel.

Theme: Importance of Instructors Rooted in Respect and Shared Cultural Context
Sub-theme: Authentic Engagement and Genuine Respect
Trustworthiness was perceived as stemming from genuine engagement and respectful intent, rather than solely from shared identity. Most participants expressed a preference for facilitators perceived as “coming correct.” For our community experts, this meant that, regardless of the instructor’s race, ethnicity, culture, or background, instructors could be accepted if they demonstrated commitment, genuine care, and an awareness of local realities. 

Sub-theme: Shared Community and Culture
Community experts emphasized that authentic engagement emerges most naturally when programs are led by instructors who belong to the same community and culture as participants. Shared culture and lived experience create an immediate sense of trust, belonging, and safety, allowing participants to feel “seen and understood without explanation.” Familiar language, recognition of common challenges, and empathy rooted in shared experiences, community experts stated, reduce feelings of alienation and foster open communication. In this way, community experts argued that the instructor’s presence is not just instructional but relational. These qualities make community members recognize that the instructor “already knows” and can connect on a human level. Community experts further argued that community-led programs, even if led by a lay individual from the community, can be uniquely effective, as meaningful connection and comfort are built in from the start. Should MBCT be taught by lay instructors from the community, our community experts enthusiastically endorsed a peer-to-peer teaching model to promote program sustainability, further community ownership, foster relatability and empowerment, and reduce reliance on external professionals who may not already share community and culture.

Sub-theme: Shared Race and Ethnicity
Community experts expressed a preference for ethnoracial concordance, feeling that professionals of similar backgrounds were more likely to better understand their experiences and culture. This led to increased comfort, trust, and rapport in programs and therapeutic contexts. Although shared race and ethnicity were viewed as helpful, community experts argued that they were not the sole determinant of successful engagement. Rather, respect and cultural competence remained paramount.

Theme: Nuanced Acceptance of Mindfulness Practices
Sub-theme: Mindfulness Meditation for Pain and Relaxation
A large share of our community experts had positive experiences with mindfulness practices for pain management and relaxation. Activities such as grounding exercises and sensory tasks helped community experts cultivate present-moment awareness and reduce overdependence on medications.
 
Sub-theme: Mindfulness Meditation Within Cultural and Spiritual Frameworks
Mindfulness meditation provoked divergent responses with some community experts finding practices unfamiliar or difficult. Others more related to meditation as a form of prayer, a culturally resonant coping strategy. Thus, our community experts emphasized adaptation of language, openness to various faith traditions, and individualized practice as essential while at the same time calling for such activities to remain decoupled from any particular spiritual or religious orientation.

Sub-theme: Mindful Movement Improves Well-being
Community experts valued mindful movement practices that supported relaxation and physical awareness. Guided walking sessions and small movements fostered connection to their bodies and provided mental respite, with a focus on tailoring movement to individual capacity and preference.

Sub-theme: Diversify Mindful Movement Exercises  
Community experts requested for flexible, inclusive, and diversified physical activities. They mentioned chair yoga, gentle stretching, dance, and alternative movement practices such as Tai Chi and acknowledged that “one size does not fit all.” Community experts also emphasized the importance of cultural responsiveness in labeling and facilitating physical activities, thus enabling comfort and respect for faith backgrounds and personal boundaries.

Discussion
Overview and Key Findings
We conducted a sub-study within a larger study aimed at adapting MBCT for older Black adults experiencing CP and co-occurring depression. This sub-study utilized CE Studios grounded in a participatory CBPR approach to better understand perceptions of MBCT for this population. Qualitative analysis of these CE Studios yielded three central themes: (1) preference for flexible and sustainable program delivery; (2) the importance of instructors rooted in respect and shared cultural context; and (3) nuanced acceptance of mindfulness practices. 

Findings from our qualitative analysis both corroborate and extend upon existing literature on barriers to mind-body interventions (MBI) and cognitive-behavioral interventions among Black adults with CP and depression. Although MBIs have been shown to provide mild-to-moderate improvements in both pain and depressive symptoms (Pham, Kincade, et al., 2023), prior research has documented disproportionately worse pain outcomes among Black communities (Pham, Doorley, et al., 2023; Vyas et al., 2020, 2022). Yet, uptake of MBIs in these communities remains limited, in part due to perceived cultural incongruence, structural barriers to access, and enduring medical mistrust rooted in historical harms (Pham, Kincade, et al., 2023; Scharff et al., 2010).

Community expert emphasis on sustainability, compensation, and community-based venues directly reflected recommendations from the literature on intervention adaptation. For example, MBIs, when delivered through trusted community organizations by instructors who are racially and/or culturally concordant with participants, increase acceptability and engagement (Haidar et al., 2023; Kreuter & McClure, 2004). Our community experts confirmed that their willingness to attend and persist in MBCT would be influenced not only by intervention content but also the instructor’s capacity to authentically invest in the lives, economic realities, and overall well-being of the community.

Program Flexibility, Sustainability, and Relevance
Community experts made clear that superficial or one-off research efforts exacerbate distrust. Instead, long-term partnership and economic inclusivity were seen as vital for success. These findings support calls for community-engaged research that addresses inequities and incorporates input from conception to implementation (Israel et al., 2012; Wallerstein et al., 2017). 

Furthermore, community expert appreciation for community-based delivery, peer support, and the sharing of community resources reflected broader movements toward task-sharing and lay-facilitated interventions (Pham, Kincade, et al., 2023). These approaches build community capacity, embed interventions within lived realities, and foster resilience through interdependence and storytelling, factors especially powerful for marginalized populations (Oetzel et al., 2015; Singla et al., 2017).

Based on community expert feedback, rotating programs across neighborhoods and combining in-person with virtual sessions would address both transportation and accessibility needs, a recurring barrier in extant studies. Importantly, community experts advocated for a hybrid delivery model that would fit the complex lives of older adults with pain and mobility limitations. These suggestions resonate with research on telehealth and hybrid models, which suggests these adaptations can partially mitigate access inequities when properly resourced (Kruse et al., 2017).

Instructor Characteristics: Trust, Community, and Representation
The theme of instructor trustworthiness, rooted in genuine community engagement, cultural attunement, or shared background, echoes a core principle in culturally adaptive interventions: while representation matters, intent and proximity are equally significant (Cabassa & Baumann, 2013). Findings from our qualitative analysis add nuance, suggesting that while older Black adults may value racial concordance, respect and understanding of local context can, at times, outweigh shared-identity, especially when the individual demonstrates a genuine investment in their lived realities.

Our findings suggest that shared experiences and cultural identity between MBCT instructors and older Black adults deepen trust, echoing calls to recruit instructors from within target communities (Alvidrez et al., 2019; Haidar et al., 2023). However, our qualitative analysis further illuminates complexities surrounding ethnic concordance, such as concerns about appearing exclusionary or experiencing misinterpretation from outsiders, dynamics underexplored in previous research.

Mindfulness Meditation and Movement: Cultural and Spiritual Adaptation
Our qualitative findings on mindfulness practices expand on prior research by highlighting both enthusiasm for and ambivalence about these practices among older Black adults. For some, mindfulness provided transformative tools for pain and mood management; for others, meditation’s perceived cultural or spiritual disconnect was a barrier. The call for faith- and spirituality-sensitive language and practices, or the use of familiar analogs (e.g., prayer, knitting, walking), underscores the necessity of cultural humility and adaptation (Bryant-Davis & Wong, 2013; Haidar et al., 2023; Kabat-Zinn et al., 1990).

Diverse reactions from the community experts to terminology like “yoga” or “meditation” reinforce the need to avoid prescriptive, one-size-fits-all program approaches. As in prior research, integration of movement-based mindfulness (such as chair yoga, line dancing, or walking) and transparency about spiritual ideology are key to fostering engagement (Woods-Giscombé & Gaylord, 2014). Moreover, honoring musical and intergenerational traditions can root mindfulness in cultural familiarity, increasing engagement and sustainability (Watkins et al., 2006).

Strengths and Limitations
Our qualitative study’s strengths include its CBPR design, grounding in a trusted community organization, and intentional focus on representation throughout CE Studio recruitment and facilitation. Our robust thematic analysis, informed by lived community experience and interdisciplinary researchers, increased transferability. However, as with all qualitative research, our findings may have been influenced by the specific local context, overrepresentation of women, and possible social desirability in CE Studio dialogue. Generalizability to older Black adults is limited outside Boston or with different religious affiliations, educational backgrounds, or levels of digital literacy. Additionally, community experts were selected with mild-moderate depression and existing interest in group health interventions, introducing potential selection bias. The implications may not fully extend to those with more severe mental health concerns or low baseline interest in group-based therapies.

Conclusion
Adapting MBCT for older Black adults with CP and depression necessitates more than a translation of existing protocols. It requires deep partnership, sustained commitment, and culturally grounded co-creation. Our findings suggest that MBCT, rooted in trust, flexibility, and community wisdom, can be transformative for older Black adults with CP and depression. Thus, as part of a larger study, we plan to develop and pilot MBCT for the CP-depression co-morbidity among older Black adults. Beyond this adaptation, our findings offer a blueprint for future interventions aimed at dismantling inequities and advancing social justice for populations historically excluded from pain, behavioral health, and mind-body research and practices.

Illustrative Quotes from the Community Engagement Studios

Sub-Theme	Representative Quotes from Community Experts
Theme: Flexible and Sustainable Program Delivery
Self-Sustainability Through Community- Based Delivery	    • “A lot of people that are dealing with pain every day also are disabled. So, they don’t have that income.”
    • "I think it's important that this program isn’t just a one-time thing. It should be ongoing, something that lives in the community and keeps going, not just a quick project."

In-Person Options at Thoughtful Locations	    • “I just like to do it the old-fashioned way. I like to see and meet people, you know?”
    • “I was impressed when you [the facilitator] were saying you was looking for a local library to hold these discussions. This library is right down my alley.”
    • “I’m not that computer savvy yet. Right now I have a hard time filling out stuff on computer, even signing my name. So virtual seems a little hard.”
    • “I was impressed when you were looking for a local library to hold discussions. This library is right down my alley.”
    • “Sometimes it’s nice to get out of the house and be with people like the lady said. So having a choice is important.”

Shorter Sessions with Flexible Arrival and Departure Times	    • "I think shorter sessions would be easier for people. Two hours is a lot. Sometimes people are tired or uncomfortable sitting for so long."
    • "It takes a while for people to get comfortable and open up. You might need some extra time at the start or after the session to talk to others."
    • "Having some flexibility with when you come and go would be nice. Sometimes people are running late or need to leave early, and that should be okay."
    • “After the session, maybe leave space for people to network and share.”
Online Options for Accessibility and Convenience	    • “Have to consider Zoom as well because in the winter weather you’re not going to get people with pain coming out, that’s just not going to happen. They gonna want to start canceling sessions and those are things to just consider”
    • "Having virtual access is good because sometimes it’s just too hard to get out, but it shouldn’t replace the in-person fully."
    • “Having a website probably would be easiest, just because people don’t need to download another app on their phone. And if they don’t have a smartphone, they can also use a computer or library."
    • “Having audio or video on apps people already use makes it easier to just pop in and follow along without fussing over new apps or confusing websites.”
	    • "It takes a while for people to get comfortable and open up. You might need some extra time at the start or after the session to talk to others."
    • "Having some flexibility with when you come and go would be nice. Sometimes people are running late or need to leave early, and that should be okay."
    • “After the session, maybe leave space for people to network and share.”
Theme: Instructor Concordance Rooted in Engagement and Respect
Authentic Engagement and Genuine Respect	    • "They [the instructors] gotta come correct. It’s not just about sharing knowledge—it's about really caring, being invested in the community."
    • “It’s more about commitment and care and awareness of our day to day than just what your skin color is.”
    • "You don’t have to be our race, but you gotta respect where we come from and show you’re truly interested."

Shared Community and Culture	    • “In a different community … you might feel like ‘how do I fit in here?’ But in this community, I’m around my own people. So I fit, even if my skin might not look the same someone else’s.”
    • “If folks in the community can teach the program, it sticks better and we keep it going without waiting on someone from outside,”
    • "When the instructor shares your background and culture, it just makes the whole program feel safer and more real."
    • “People open up more when everyone knows the rules about respect and listening.”
Shared Race and Ethnicity	    • “I’d rather deal with someone in my same race because the majority of the time, they grew up where I grew up.”

Theme: Nuanced Acceptability of Mindfulness and Movement Practices
Mindfulness Meditation for Pain and Relaxation	    • "Mindfulness meditation helps with pain and makes me feel calm."
    • "Practices like mindful walking and grounding exercises helped me focus on the present instead of the pain."
    • "Those ‘raisin exercises’ or sensory things helped distract me from pain and relaxed me."

Mindfulness Meditation Within Cultural and Spiritual 
Frameworks	    • “Black Americans, I don’t think we meditate …cause, our life is totally different from other races. And you really don’t have no time to be meditating.”
    • “Way back then, what my great grandfather used to tell us, all they had was prayer.”
    • “When we meditate, we don’t push faith but we pray and so it’s the difference in language that makes it”
    • “Meditation could work better over like knitting, quilting, little activities like that.”

Mindful Movement Improves Well-being	    • "I don’t have an issue with stretching and things like that. It helps with relaxation and makes me aware of my body."
    • "Guided walking and small movements gave me mental breaks and made me feel connected to my body."

Accommodate 
Physical Limitations with Variety	    • “I don’t have an issue with stretching and all those things, but me being a Christian, I would have an issue if the instructor said yoga.“
    • "Not everyone can do the same movements, so having options or just gentle movements is important."

Implications for Practice and Policy

#	Recommendation
1	Invest in long-term, compensated partnerships and community co-leadership.
2	Design hybrid, flexible delivery that accommodates pain, mobility, and weather constraints while ensuring access for the digitally excluded.
3	Prioritize the recruitment and training of instructors with shared community or cultural backgrounds, but ensure all instructors receive deep training in cultural humility and local realities.
4	Explicitly integrate spiritual flexibility, allowing for personalized or collective faith- and gratitude-based practices.
5	Support resource-list building, peer networks, and the normalization of alternative and heritage healing practices.
6	Wider implementation of MBCT for older Black adults should be accompanied by rigorous evaluation, sustainability, and partnerships with Black-led organizations and faith communities.
7	Attention to historical trauma, anti-racism, and structural barriers should remain foregrounded throughout adaptation and delivery.
