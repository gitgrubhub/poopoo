We assembled a team of community experts to participate in Community Engaged Studios focused on MBCT for the chronic pain-depression co-morbidity among Black Elders.
Each CE Studio session explored (1) barriers and facilitators to participation; and (2) perceptions of MBCT skills (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, CBT) as per MBCT for chronic pain and MBCT for Depression. 

## Demographic Variables

21 Black Elders joined our Community Engaged Studios. Community participants ranged in age from 51 to 84 years (average 68 years old). Most participants were female (85%), and the sample was predominantly Protestant Baptist (60%), with additional representation from other Christian denominations. Educational attainment was highest at the high school level (60%), with the remainder holding college or vocational degrees. Geographically, most lived in Dorchester/Roxbury (40%) or Boston (25%), with a few from other cities and regions. Over half of the sample was retired (55%), but participants had varied occupational backgrounds. Most participants were single (40%) or widowed (35%). Mean Numeric Rating Scale scores indicated moderately high pain (mean 7.03), and PHQ-9 scores suggested a moderate level of depressive symptoms (mean 7.03). Chronic medical conditions such as pain, hypertension, and diabetes were common, with some individuals reporting multiple health issues; psychiatric diversity was also present, though a notable portion reported no psychiatric diagnoses.

## Qualitative Results 
Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts revealed four main themes: *Scheduling and Attending*, *Encouraging Instructor Characteristics*, *Enhancing Mindfulness Meditation and Movement*, and *Enhancing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy*.  

Within *Scheduling and Attending*, participants emphasized *persistent and self-sustainable delivery*, *in-person options at thoughtful locations*, *virtual options for accessibility and convenience*, and *shorter sessions with flexible arrival and departure times*; in *Encouraging Instructor Characteristics*, sub-themes included *authentic engagement and genuine respect*, *shared community and culture*, and *shared race and ethnicity*; under *Enhancing Mindfulness Meditation and Movement*, sub-themes encompassed *mindfulness meditation for pain and relaxation*, *mindfulness meditation within cultural and spiritual frameworks*, *mindful movement to improve well-being*, and *accommodating physical limitations with variety*; and in *Enhancing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy*, sub-themes included *simplifying medical and psychological terminology for understanding* and *incorporating group support and community resources*.  


## Theme: Scheduling and Attending

### Sub-theme: Persistent and self-sustainable delivery

Participants emphasized the importance of ongoing engagement with the Black Elder community beyond just research or short-term involvement. They expressed a desire for programs that remained connected to the community instead of coming in merely to collect data and then leaving without further commitment. The emphasis is on truly fitting in and being part of the community, even when acceptance is challenging, highlighting a need for sustained relationships and continuity.

There was also a strong call for programs to incorporate meaningful compensation and economic balance for participants, recognizing the full spectrum of community members, including those who are disabled or living with chronic pain who may have limited income. The speaker stresses the necessity of securing grant funding to sustain programs over time without imposing financial burdens on the community members who need the most support. This model aims to respect participants’ time, effort, and expenses, such as travel, ensuring fairness and long-term viability.
> You a lot of people that are dealing with pain every day also are disabled. So, they don't have that income.

Finally, the speaker references existing connection programs that provide valuable services like caregiving support, childcare, and meals, illustrating the holistic approach needed. The overall message urges organizers to design programs that genuinely benefit the community, improve its condition sustainably, and avoid the pitfall of superficial interactions intended only to boost numbers. Participants stated that the goal is lasting impact and empowerment rather than short-term gains.

### Sub-theme: In-person options at thoughtful locations

Participants discussed the importance of location when organizing community programs, particularly in neighborhoods like Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan. Many participants express a preference for holding events in familiar, local venues such as libraries, parks, schools, and community centers rather than downtown or remote locations. They emphasized that convenience and accessibility are crucial, especially for those who rely on public transportation or have mobility issues. Rotating the location across several neighborhoods is suggested to make programs more inclusive and accessible for everyone.

Personal interaction is highlighted as a vital aspect of these gatherings. The participants prefer in-person meetings to online sessions, stating that face-to-face engagement helps them connect, share experiences, and support one another, particularly for those dealing with chronic pain or isolation. While some acknowledge that virtual meetings via Zoom are necessary during bad weather or for those with transportation challenges, many express discomfort with using technology and value the traditional, personal approach.

> I have a hard time filling out stuff, on, on, on computer, even signing my name. So I mean, that seems a little hard. I'm not that computer savvy, yet I
> Vicki: I'm not good with the computer either?

Lastly, the group suggests that involving local venues not only improves access but can also strengthen ties within the community, potentially offering economic benefits. They note the importance of considering compensation for local facilitators and utilizing various types of spaces, like health centers or gyms, to accommodate different activities. The overall message is that thoughtful planning of location and delivery—all while respecting individual preferences and circumstances—will lead to greater participation and positive outcomes.

### Sub-theme: Virtual options for accessibility and convenience

Participants discussed the importance of flexibility and accommodation in designing programs for people with varying needs, especially those dealing with chronic pain. It highlights that while in-person participation is preferred for many to foster social connection and active engagement, there must be understanding around timing and attendance, recognizing that emergencies or physical limitations may affect punctuality and consistency. The conversation stresses time management to minimize disruptions and the value of committing to designated meeting times.

Additionally, the text advocates for hybrid program formats that combine in-person and virtual sessions. This approach addresses challenges such as inclement weather and mobility issues, making participation more feasible and less burdensome. Virtual options allow individuals to engage from home, reducing travel time and energy expenditure, which is especially important for those managing pain. Integrating activities into participants’ home environments is seen as beneficial for sustained practice and independence, increasing the likelihood that skills learned will be maintained and applied.

> “I just like to do it the old-fashioned way. I like to see and meet people, you know?”
> “Have to consider maybe you know zoom as well because in the winter in the weather it's bad you're not going to get people with pain coming out, that's just not going to happen. But then they gonna want to start canceling sessions and you know so those are things to just consider”

> “I like it being here, I was impressed when you were saying you was looking for a library Roxbury, Dorchester [to conduct focus groups ] yeah that's down my alley."

### Sub-theme: Shorter sessions with flexible arrival and departure times
Despite some seeing two hours as reasonable, others raised concerns about the commitment required, especially for programs running weekly over two months. For people managing health challenges, pain, or busy schedules, this commitment is significant, particularly when considering preparation and travel, which can extend the time burden substantially. 

Thus, participants voiced a strong preference for session contents to be abbreviated. 

Participants also reported that an abbreviated session format would permit other needed activities before and after the session.
For example, many community events require built in flexibility for late starts or running over due to unexpected occurrences. 

Contributors noted that it often takes about 30 to 40 minutes for genuine, meaningful conversations to develop, emphasizing the need for enough time to allow participants to get comfortable, settle in, and become engaged, especially for older participants or those needing time to get their bearings. Participants could also network afterwards.


The Community-Engaged Studio considered several time options, but most of the community participants preferred a one-hour session with 30-minute buffer periods as a practical compromise. 

## Theme: Favored instructor characteristics  
 
### Sub-theme: Authentic engagement and genuine respect

Participants reported that trustworthiness in community programming is ultimately what is linked to respect, intent, and authentic engagement rather than simply shared identity. Participants emphasized that being an outsider is not necessarily a barrier as long as the facilitator demonstrates genuine respect for the community and a clear, positive mission. The focus shifts from the instructor's background to how they approach the community and whether their presence reflects a commitment to understanding, listening, and delivering value. When instructors show respect and awareness for the community’s needs and experiences, they are seen as trustworthy, regardless of racial or cultural background.

Additionally, participants reported that trust is enhanced when programs are held within the community and delivered by people who understand the local context, needs, and lived experiences of attendees. Participants note that familiarity with the community’s realities leads to empathy and more open communication, making people feel comfortable, heard, and respected. Incorporating local involvement and ensuring economic benefit to the community further adds to the sense that the programming is not only trustworthy but also beneficial and rooted in genuine care for community well-being.


### Sub-theme: Shared community and culture
Besides race and ethnicity, participants also strongly underscored the sense of *shared community and ownership* when mind-body programs are led by individuals who are part of the same community as the attendees. 

> Yeah so you in a different environment ... you feel like, you know, how do I fit in here? But in here, I'm around my own people. So I fit, even though my skin don’t look like, look like that.

There is a feeling of genuine connection and understanding when instructors and facilitators reflect the cultural backgrounds and lived experiences of participants. This fosters trust and comfort, making it easier for attendees to engage openly, feel that their needs are anticipated, and receive support that is empathetic and authentic.

Participants highlighted that mutual understanding goes beyond just race or background—it is about a shared context and ability to relate to life’s challenges. The group notes how small things, like the tone of a guided meditation or the presence of familiar faces, make a significant difference in comfort levels. Attendees express that when facilitators “already know” what they’re feeling, it relieves the burden of explanation, enabling participants to focus on the therapeutic aspects of the sessions rather than feelings of alienation or the need to code-switch.

Ultimately, participants focused on the importance of *community-driven programs.* When programs are designed, led, and facilitated by those within the community, participants feel a deeper sense of belonging and safety. This is contrasted with experiences where, despite incentives, attendees do not feel fully at ease in settings with unfamiliar facilitators. The conversation reaffirms that a strong shared community among instructors and attendees is key to encouraging engagement, promoting relaxation, and maximizing the benefits of mind-body interventions.

### Sub-theme: Shared race and ethnicity
**ethnoracial concordance**

Participants emphasized the strong preference to engage with professionals and service providers who share their racial or ethnic background, particularly within BIPOC communities. Participants reported that this preference stemmed from a belief that those from similar racial or cultural backgrounds have a deeper understanding of shared experiences, values, and cultural nuances—such as specific hair textures or community upbringing—that outsiders might not fully grasp. Participants reported feeling that connecting with someone of the same race or ethnicity helps create a sense of comfort, trust, and mutual understanding, which facilitates better communication and support.

> I'd rather deal with someone in my same race because the majority of the time, they grew up where I grew up.

At the same time, participants acknowledged complexities around these preferences, including misunderstandings or accusations of racism when expressing the desire to work with people of the same race. Some participants have had to explain their reasoning to others who initially misinterpreted their stance. Despite this, they emphasize the importance of professionals recognizing and respecting where individuals are coming from both culturally and personally. Overall, the discussion highlighted that shared race and ethnicity play a critical role in building rapport and effectiveness in community programs designed for people of color, while also recognizing the need for respect and openness within diverse family and community contexts.



## Theme: Enhancing mindfulness meditation and movement 

### Sub-theme: Mindfulness meditation for pain and relaxation

Many participants described their positive experiences with mindfulness classes and meditation, often emphasizing the value of holistic approaches for managing pain and enhancing well-being. One participant described a mindfulness class, run through Boston Medical, that helped individuals reconnect with their senses, emotions, and thought patterns—teaching them techniques to redirect pain and reduce reliance on narcotics or conventional medication. Participants highlighted the class as transformative, reporting improvements in chronic pain and a greater sense of bodily awareness. Activities such as mindful walking, grounding exercises, and even unique practices like the "raisin exercise" were mentioned as instrumental in helping people become more present and attentive to their physical states.

Participants also reflected on the importance of adapting wellness practices to accommodate individual needs and preferences. 

Participants recommended that mindfulness sessions provide choice, avoid imposing spiritual beliefs, and include space for open discussion about the unique challenges faced by people of color living with chronic pain. Ultimately, the consensus was that offering a variety of accessible practices—along with peer support and understanding facilitators—leads to more meaningful engagement and relief.

### Sub-theme: Mindfulness meditation within cultural and spiritual frameworks

Mindfulness meditation was not uniformly accepted by our participants. The previously mentioned mindfulness class offered through Boston Medical brought together a small group of participants for a year-long journey exploring various practices, including mindful eating and experiential exercises. One notable activity was the “raisin exercise,” where participants were encouraged to engage all senses while holding and tasting a raisin, highlighting each person’s unique perceptions and experiences. For some, these practices unlocked new forms of awareness or reflection, though others found aspects uncomfortable or hard to engage with, revealing the importance of tailoring techniques to individual comfort levels.

> “Black Americans, I don’t think we meditate ...cause, our life is totally different from other races. And you really don't have no time to be meditating.“

Overall, there is strong emphasis on openness, choice, and respect for diverse viewpoints when integrating these practices into group settings.

Many participants situated practices like meditation within their own cultural and spiritual frameworks, revealing a preference for prayer and gratitude as familiar grounding rituals. Some highlighted that prayer, more than meditation, resonates deeply in their community—serving as both a coping mechanism and a reaffirmation of faith, especially in times of hardship. 
> “Meditation is praying.”
> “Way back then, from my understanding, what my great grandfather used to tell us, that's all they had was prayer. I mean, you know, they were living to keep them going, you know.”
> “When you say meditate, we don't push faith but we pray and so it's the difference in language makes it”

The conversation underscores the importance of language and flexibility, suggesting that wellness initiatives should honor spiritual distinctions and personal boundaries while supporting collective wellbeing.

One participant suggested to allow “meditation over like knitting, quilting, like little activities like that. Yeah.”

### Sub-theme: Mindful movement improves well-being
There is significant appreciation for mindful movement practices that focus attention on body mechanics and present-moment sensations. A participant recounts a positive experience with a guided mindful walking session, where careful attention to each movement facilitated a sense of relaxation and body awareness. This detailed focus allowed for mental reprieve and contributed to a greater sense of bodily connection, demonstrating the therapeutic value of such interventions for pain management and mindfulness.

### Sub-theme: Accommodate physical limitations with variety 

Participants emphasized the necessity of variety, adaptability, and inclusivity in exercise routines, particularly for individuals managing chronic pain, mobility limitations, or recovery from surgeries. They stressed that there is no single blueprint for wellness—what supports one person’s health may be inaccessible or even harmful to another. Many described tailoring their activities to avoid pain triggers and accommodate unique bodily needs, using approaches such as chair yoga, mindfulness practices focused on small, gentle movements, or simply sitting out when certain activities are not feasible. This flexibility ensures that participants can remain engaged without compromising their comfort or safety.

Participants reported a spectrum of engagement with mind-body practices like yoga, meditation, tai chi, and movement-based mindfulness, alongside activities such as water aerobics, line dancing, and in-home strength training. While some found yoga and meditation highly beneficial, others preferred alternatives—either due to physical constraints or discomfort with the spiritual or cultural associations of certain practices. Sensitivity to cultural context emerged as a recurring theme, with many stressing the importance of transparent language when describing activities (for example, labeling a class as “stretching exercises” instead of “yoga”) to ensure that participation aligns with personal values. This culturally responsive approach, coupled with multiple exercise options—ranging from aquatic therapy to gentle walking—helps sustain both physical health and personal agency.

For Black elders in particular, wellness practices often intertwine with cultural traditions, intergenerational wisdom, and community connection. Participants described relying on familiar and non-invasive approaches such as daily walking, music-infused activities, and rhythm-based movement to maintain mobility and emotional well-being. Group activities like line dancing, bowling, and tai chi were celebrated not only for their physical benefits, but also for their ability to stimulate memory, foster social bonds, and honor cultural roots. Whether through family encouragement to “lubricate the joints” or through collective participation in music and dance, these practices reinforce the value of programs that respect faith backgrounds, celebrate cultural identity, and provide accessible pathways for lifelong movement and connection.  

> “I don't have an issue with stretching and all those things, but me being a Christian, I would have an issue with when you say yoga.“

## Theme: Enhancing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
### Sub-theme: Simplify medical and psychological terminology for understanding
Participants voiced endorsement for cognitive-behavioral therapy for the chronic pain-depression co-morbidity. 

> "We should talk more about what we can do to help at our pain”

However, participants highlighted significant concerns around language and communication within healthcare and educational settings, particularly focusing on clarity and accessibility. Participants express frustration with complex or technical language, such as the term "cognitive," which many do not understand without further explanation. 

> "As far as cognitive, you need to expand that more so everyone will understand what it is that you're referring to."

Participants pointed to a broader issue: the use of jargon or advanced terms can alienate or confuse people, especially those managing chronic health conditions or seniors who need clear and simple instructions. Participants suggested the importance of breaking down complex ideas into straightforward language so that all individuals could grasp the meaning and apply the information safely.

Participants also underscored a need for language that respected diverse backgrounds and beliefs. For instance, there was a discussion about how mindfulness or meditation practices should avoid imposing specific religious language or faith-based terms on others. Instead, participants advocated for inclusive language that allows individuals to engage in ways consistent with their own spiritual or cultural practices. This approach to language aims to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and respected without feeling pressured to conform to someone else’s belief system.

Visual aids and the presentation of information in manageable portions are emphasized as important tools to support comprehension. Participants mention that pictorials and clear graphics help draw attention and make content easier to understand, especially when combined with concise highlighting of key points instead of lengthy text. This suggests that the format and language style are both crucial for effective communication, particularly for people who may experience cognitive or processing challenges, ensuring that information is not overwhelming.

Finally, participants reflected on the broader theme of empowerment through language — patients want to understand what treatments they receive, what medications do, and the realities of managing their conditions. 

> “These are warning signs that I never knew about. “

This desire highlights the need for transparent, respectful, and educational communication from healthcare providers. Ultimately, the language used can affect how people perceive their care, advocate for themselves, and manage their health, making clear, accessible, and inclusive language an essential component of effective healthcare and education.

> “A lot of people don’t know that there’s a patient bill of rights."

## Sub-theme: Incorporate group support and community resources 
Personal narratives connected generational attitudes toward pain, coping, and self-care. Several discussed the legacy of “tough love,” how strict or unsupportive upbringings contributed to learned endurance and, at times, emotional challenges. The conversation underscored the need to break cycles of silence or severity, instead favoring vulnerability, compassion, and team-oriented healing. 

Some express that exchanging stories about pain, remedies, and case studies not only educates but also builds mutual understanding and reduces isolation.

Participants revealed an active community already exchanging resources and experiences around health, pain management, and well-being. 

Participants highlighted the growth of wellness opportunities—from local exercise programs and support groups, to free or low-cost activities like yoga, swimming, walking clubs, and dance classes held at schools, parks, and community centers. There’s emphasis on sharing information, building comprehensive resource lists, and collaborating to ensure more people—especially those who lacked options or communication in the past—can access these supports.

> “Educating people [that] there are other options -- getting your back wrapped, and all that other stuff, you know what I mean”

Alongside sharing practical resources, contributors discuss the need for holistic engagement. They describe the value of structured programs (such as the “HELL” program) that blend educational materials, exercise routines, and group motivation, noting that these methods can be empowering and energizing. 

Many highlight their use of alternative medicine, traditional remedies, and faith, reinforcing the importance of open dialogue about diverse ways to manage pain and heal—beyond medication alone—while nurturing belonging, resilience, and hope within the community.

> “We don’t have insurance, we don’t have money, you know. So, our grandparents, great-great grandparents turned to different remedies that worked. Just some basic cooking things that you’d put together. Here, drink this, your cold will go away, you know.”

Participants also voice the importance of accountability and flexibility—encouraging sharing coping strategies but resisting rigid expectations—so individuals feel supported, not pressured.
